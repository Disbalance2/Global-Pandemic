 Turkey.5.t: "Turkish Presidential Election of 2000"
 Turkey.5.desc: "The 2000 Presidential Election is at hand. In Turkey, the President is chosen by the parliament. In order for one candidate to win, they must receive a two-thirds majority in one of the two rounds. If there is no victor, the third round can be won by a simple majority. If there is still no clear winner, a fourth round is held where one of the two most popular candidates must achieve a majority. If there still isn't a victory, a snap election must be held to break the deadlock.\n\nAt the moment, each parliamentary party is running their own candidate, and it seems very unlikely that any of them will come out on top."

In his speech, [TUR.GetLeader] also mentioned that there will be a "inspection of all ranks", and that "there must be no traitors left". Though it is unknown what will happen to the officials involved, one thing is for certain, and that is the role of the military in Turkish politics is no more."

In other cities within Turkey, citizens have took up arms and they have begun opening fire at the soldiers stationed in their cities, in an attempt to halt the coup. The military announced that the coup is justified, and that the leader must be overthrown to save the Turkish nation, and some people in the country support them on this. However for now, the scenes in Turkey resemble that of a civil war, rather than just another military coup."

 TUR_afrin_desc: "Kurdish terrorists go by many names, but that does not mean they do not share the same ideals as each other.

Olive Branch will put an end to Kurdish terror attacks originating from the YPG held territory of Afrin. The operation is determined to root out and destroy Kurdish terrorists without collateral damage, we must proceed carefully."

 TUR_afrin_d: "Turkish Forces Threaten Afrin"
 TUR_afrin_d_desc: "The Turkish onslaught of Kurdish people continues. The threat of an invasion of Afrin is real, as the Turkish president [their_country.GetLeader], unsurprisingly branded us as terrorists aligned with the PKK and threatened to strangle us before we could attack Turkish land in a ridiculous terror attack. This is not our way, but we must prepare for an attack immediately!"
 TUR_afrin_d2: "Turkish Forces Continue to Advance"
 TUR_afrin_d2_desc: "They call it \"Operation Olive Branch\", funny how the saying goes that the olive branch is in offer of peace.

 strenghten_outposts_4_desc: "New outposts prove to be enough at repelling terrorist attacks or not getting attacked in the first place, now terrorists are avoiding the strong ones and focusing on the old, weaker ones.
