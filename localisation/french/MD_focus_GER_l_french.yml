 GER_oekosteuer_desc: "Now that the atomic energy is out of the way, we also need to focus on the non-renewable energy forms. By increasing existing taxes for the enrgy suppliers we can stimulate the need to invest in more clean energy forms like the wind- or solar energy."

 GER_renewable_energies_law_desc: "Its predecessor from 1991 made an big step towards an greener future, but renewable energies like solar energies or wind turbines are still not economically reasonable.

 GER_reform_ministry_agriculture_desc: "For many years the ministry had the word 'Forst' (forest) in it, but its significancy dropped massively over the years. Instead the topics of data and consumer protection became more important. Reforming the ministry should help it to tackle its future tasks"

 GER_verbundene_vertrauensfrage_desc: "The Vertrauensfrage is an important instrument to measure the approval of the current Bundeskanzler and his policy. If it passes he can be sure to have the majority behind him. If it fails however, the consequences would be significant.

 GER_reform_bafog_desc: "Originally intended to help the students to pay there studium, the former government under chancelor Kohl 'reformed' the fund in such a way, that it became too unatractive for students to apply for it at all.

 GER_forbid_npd_desc: "Often seen as the follower of the NSDAP in terms of ideology, the NPD is an ultranationalist party in the far right spectrum.\nSadly in the recent past, attacks against foreigners and other minorities in Germany such as gay couples increased again.

 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry: "CDU Ties to the Automotive Industry"
 GER_conservative_ties_to_the_automotive_industry_desc: "While the Christian conservative CDU/CSU is not as deeply connected to the automotive industry as Gerhard Schröder is with Volkswagen, several important German car manufacturers are still located in predominantly conservative states in the south, notably Porsche and Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg and BMW in Munich, Bavaria."
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe: "Automotive Investments in Europe"
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe_desc: "By aggressively pushing into other European markets, German car manufacturers could drastically reduce their personnel costs by leaving German industry and thus German wages behind in favor of European Union member states with lower standards of living. Mercedes-Benz seeks additional investments in Kecskemét, Hungary, whereas Volkswagen desires support for expansion in Bratislava, Slovakia."
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen: "Strengthen Volkswagen"
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen_desc: "The German Ministry of Finance found that 30% of jobs in Lower Saxony are either directly provided by or indirectly dependent on Volkswagen, the largest company in Germany and Germany's main corporate applicant of soft power abroad. Several percentage points of the German economy are solely provided by this one company - it is too big to fail."

 GER_the_kaluga_plant_desc: "Some 150 kilometers southeast of Russia's capital Moscow and located on the regional Oka River, Kaluga in the Kaluga Oblast has been identified by the Volkswagen group as a potential good fit to build VW or Audi models. This Kaluga plant could employ over 5,000 Russians at wages far lower than the automotive giants would have to pay to Germans."
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant: "The Aurangabad Plant"
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant_desc: "India is a large untapped market for the Volkswagen group. Whereas German cars are smash hits in China already, more time and marketing is needed to get the people of India, the second most populous country on earth, on board. If German companies don't act fast, Indian ones will soon pop up to fill the niche as more Indians move into economic brackets able to afford vehicles."
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china: "Expand Volkswagen into China"
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china_desc: "While the Chinese already buy Volkswagen cars, more can be done to get the company to employ Chinese laborers in the People's Republic itself. By making the government there dependent on Volkswagen's investments and labor provisions, the German market influence in China would increase drastically. The planned factories in Chengdu, Shanghai and Liaoning could easily employ tens of thousands."
 GER_dresden_and_leipzig_factories: "Dresden and Leipzig Manufacturies"
 GER_dresden_and_leipzig_factories_desc: "While it will be profitable to outsource Volkswagen jobs, it'll not make the homegrown population of automotive laborers particularly happy. In the traditional heavy labor hub that is the state of Saxony, Volkswagen plans new high skill factories - they will need a few government subsidies and tax cuts to make the project profitable, however."
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness: "Seize Opposition Weakness"
 GER_seize_opposition_weakness_desc: "With the Möllermann crisis in the FDP and the corruption scandal in the CDU/CSU, the opposition to Gerhard Schröder's SPD (red) and Joschka Fischer's Greens, who together form the government as the 'red-green coalition', is weaker than ever. This comes at an opportune moment, as the year 1999 had held several weak electoral results for the governing parties, even in traditionally left-leaning states."
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony: "Utilize SPD Influence in Lower Saxony"
 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony_desc: "Historically, the German Social Democrats, the SPD, played second fiddle to the much stronger CDU/CSU, the 'Union'. Only in 1998 did Gerhard Schröder dethrone four-term incumbent Helmut Kohl of the CDU. Schröder's power base lies in his home in Lower Saxony, one of the most loyal SPD voting states that is also home to Germany's largest company, Volkswagen, a political ally of Schröder."
 GER_infrastructural_reform: "Infrastructural Reform"
 GER_infrastructural_reform_desc: "Because of a brewing political crisis involving Minister of Infrastructure Reinhard Klimmt and his associated football club, 1. FC Saarbrücken, Klimmt should be replaced with a new Federal Minister for Traffic, Construction and Housing. Kurt Bodewig would be a worthwhile replacement."
 GER_coal_industry_compromise: "Coal Industry Compromise"
 GER_coal_industry_compromise_desc: "While SPD and Greens were united in their opposition to the liberal decisionmaking of the Union and the FDP, the downfall of Oskar Lafontaine in 1999 and the rise of Schröder's Clintonite ideology presented a clear dissonance between Greens and SPD: Whereas Fischer seeks to eliminate fossil fuel usage, the SPD wants to preserve laborers in the industry. The main conflict has always been brown coal."
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism: "Foreign Policy Pragmatism"
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism_desc: "The Schröder government has made several severe miscalculations during its first two years in office. The chancellor's push for a permanent German seat on the UN Security Council combined with a half-hearted attempt to pursue European Federalism, both of which alienated Germany's closest European partner, France. SPD and Greens need to realized the error of their ways."
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung: "Limited Budget Consolidation"
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung_desc: "One of the Schröder administration's primary goals in office, the Haushaltskonsolidierung, 'budget consolidation', is not going to happen. The budget has kept bloating under social democratic leadership and private debt keeps growing on both a per capita and a per household basis. All Germany can do now is to introduce limited budget cuts in areas like defense spending to minimize the damage."
 GER_green_card_initiative: "Green Card Initiative"
 GER_green_card_initiative_desc: "Inspired by American and Canadian immigration programs, the Schröder government has proposed the introduction of a 'Green-Card-Initiative' to quickly assemble foreign IT workers to accerelate the development of Germany's underdeveloped high-technology sector. The Kohl government before Schröder had neglected both internet and IT development, and this needs to be amended."
 GER_pension_reform: "Pension Reform"
 GER_pension_reform_desc: "One of the key talking points of the German social democrats against German conservatives has always been the size of pensions, and the electoral battle between Schröder and Kohl in 1998 was no different. Should the Schröder administration fail to at least provide token relief to Germany's elderly, the SPD's prestige among the working class would collapse utterly."
 GER_digitalized_education_system: "Digitalized Education System"
 GER_digitalized_education_system_desc: "One of Schröder's core promises during the 1998 campaign was 'Schulen ans Netz', 'schools onto the web', referring to the low rate of internet access and digitalization among German elementary and even high schools during the Kohl Administration. Seeing the 'Schulen ans Netz' program succeed would be costly, but hugely beneficial to Germany's pupils."
 GER_scientific_exchanges: "Scientific Exchanges"
 GER_scientific_exchanges_desc: "With foreign experts flocking to Germany to live and work in tech and start-up hubs like Cologne and Berlin, Germany's innovativeness has improved. To former formalize these exchanges, German research teams must regularly meet up with foreign colleagues to study and compare results."
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards: "Improved Federal Education Standards"
 GER_improved_federal_education_standards_desc: "In Germany, the concept of \"Bildungshoheit der Länder\", the 'state supremacy in education', takes away federal control of education policy and allows individual states to more autonomously set their own goals. The downside of this system is that some states' education like NRW and Bremen have fallen in prestige and standard behind that of states like Bavaria. This can be amended by federal minimums."
 GER_international_business: "International Business"
 GER_international_business_desc: "Germany often hails itself \"Exportweltmeister\", 'world champion of exports'. The German economy has traditionally seen significant trade surplusses, selling far more to other industrial nations than Germany itself purchases from them. A continuation of an export-friendly policy requires great amounts of foreign political pragmatism - the money of a dictator is just as good as the money of a popular leader, after all."
 GER_sino_german_deals: "Sino-German Deals"
 GER_sino_german_deals_desc: "Germany punches far above its weight when it comes to its export economy. The only country that comes anywhere close is the People's Republic of China, which sports more than 20 times the German population to power its insatiable economic engine. China is desperate for any way to power and more growth - the Chinese want German machines, German cars and the know-how of German companies."
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations: "Oil Trade Negotiations"
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations_desc: "The German petroleum supply is one of the country's most pressing emergencies. Germany's oil sources are diverse - Norway, Nigeria, Libya, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Scotland. Germany operates on all continents to gain and secure access to valuable resources."
 GER_nord_stream: "Nord Stream"
 GER_nord_stream_desc: "Schröder is notoriously friendly to Vladimir Putin, Russia's autocrat. The Russo-German trade relations revolve around Russian natural resources and their usage in Germany. Russian gas giant Gazprom has a plan to bypass Ukrainian and Polish oversight by getting Russian gas straight into Germany through a pipeline in the Baltic, \"Nord Stream\". This plan is great for German profits, but Eastern Europe won't like it."
 GER_appease_eastern_europe: "Appease Eastern Europe"
 GER_appease_eastern_europe_desc: "Our investments into Nord Stream pose a significant threat to Polish, Slovak, Czech and Ukrainian trade and transit profits regarding Russian oil delivered to Germany and the rest of western Europe. We have to trade the line carefully now, as to avoid completely alienating our reliable partners. Russia is not trustworthy enough to make that trade off worthwhile."
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers: "Accomodate Polish Migrant Workers"
 GER_accomodate_polish_migrant_workers_desc: "Polish labor migration into Germany goes back far in history - the 'Ruhr Poles' for example are a population of ethnic Poles in the Ruhr area that immigrated during the 19th Century to work as coal miners. Most recently, Germany and Poland signed a neighbor treaty in 1991. Hundreds of thousands of Poles enter Germany as seasonal workers every year, particularly in agriculture."
 GER_russo_german_partnership: "Russo-German Partnership"
 GER_russo_german_partnership_desc: "Polish defense minister Radoslaw Sikorski already likened our new business deals with the Russians to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It is clear that our critics are incorrect about the Poles and their friends being more reliable than the Russians - they too are just out to backstab us at an opportune moment. Russia is a worthy partner that needs to be maintained."
 GER_closer_integration_with_eaeu_markets: "Closer Integration with EAEU Markets"
 GER_closer_integration_with_eaeu_markets_desc: "The Eastern European Union is Russia's (rather poor) imitation of the EU's economic compacts. Their problem is that they really don't have the economic power to back their economic ambitions - but German cooperation might help them with that."
 GER_expand_the_rhine_route: "Expand the Rhine Route"
 GER_expand_the_rhine_route_desc: "The Rhine is the most heavily used trade river in Europe and is the shared pride of the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, France and Switzerland. Germany and the Netherlands depend on each other to maximize the trade potential."
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium: "Strengthen Ties to Belgium"
 GER_strengthen_ties_to_belgium_desc: "After closing the ranks with our Dutch neighbors, we need to also aggressively push our companies into the Belgian market. German influence on Belgium and Belgian dependence upon Germany will be essential for any future conflict between the two nations regarding the outdated nuclear power plant at Tihange, one of the primary threats to German national security."
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade: "Trans-Atlantic Trade"
 GER_trans_atlantic_trade_desc: "By investing in the \"Deutsch-Amerikanische Handelskammern\" ('German American Chambers of Commerce'), the German economy could increase its bilateral ties to the markets in the United States, particularly by tailoring high-end German goods to the needs of American industry. That would serve both the German role as an export nation and the American role as an import nation."
 GER_trade_with_canada: "Trade with Canada"
 GER_trade_with_canada_desc: "Canada holds several key strengths as a trade partner: Abundance of natural resources, a highly educated workforce, strong pre-existing ties to Europe - and a huge dependency on a single country that they'd like to diversify away from. We have to find the hidden gears that could get a German-Canadian trade deal to function."
 GER_schroeder_ii: "Schröder II"
 GER_schroeder_ii_desc: "After assuming a first term as chancellor in 1998, Schröder has won several resounding political victories. The CDU and FDP crises regarding Kohl and Möllermann, respectively, have greatly diminished the conservatives' chances to win the election. Schröder's run for reelection could however still need some campaign boosts - like declining to join American wars of aggression."
 GER_auffangbank_concept: "'Auffangbank' Concept"
 GER_auffangbank_concept_desc: "Inspired by American Resolution Trust Corporations, or RTCs, the Schröder administration has brianstormed the creation of a German 'bad bank'-esque financial institute to predict and avoid future financial crises. But that would never happen, now would it?"
 GER_back_deutsche_bank: "Back Deutsche Bank"
 GER_back_deutsche_bank_desc: "Deutsche Bank (DB) is by far the largest bank in Germany, spanning almost 100,000 employees, over 2,500 outlets and scoring incomes of 1.6 billion Euros a year, more than triple that of their closest rivals, DZ Bank, KfW and Commerzbank, all of whom make about 500 million Euros. DB is central to the German banking system - although we should be careful to not have it involved in Russian corruption."
 GER_homegrown_software: "Homegrown Software"
 GER_homegrown_software_desc: "With the 'Schulen ans Netz' program in full effect, the funds should now also be diverted towards German multimedia companies like Nuremberg-based SoftMaker to develop utility and office programs to dissuade American-made software at the workplace. The German government could also subsidize the acquisition of licenses for such programs to double the incentive."
 GER_the_internet_neuland: "The Internet 'Neuland'"
 GER_the_internet_neuland_desc: "In an infamous speech on 19 June 2013, then Chancellor Angela Merkel explained that the internet 'is new territory for us all', although more than 95% of the German population by then had connection to the internet and more than half used it regularly. Merkel's comments were in a long line of conservative mishaps in internet policies - the slow speed of German internet connection goes back all the way to Kohl."
 GER_agenda_2010: "Agenda 2010"
 GER_agenda_2010_desc: "Gerhard Schröder was always a moderate among the social democrats and thus advocated restraint with the budget. The 'Agenda 2010' is an ambitious project of budget cuts and bureaucratic reforms that will without a doubt draw heavy criticism from leftist groups and push the government towards the center - but it could be fantastic for economic progress."
 GER_sports_funding: "Sports Funding"
 GER_sports_funding_desc: "In German politics, it usually proves very effective to generate domestic profit as well as political capital by funding and supporting sporting projects, particularly football stadiums."
 GER_hartz_iv: "Hartz IV"
 GER_hartz_iv_desc: "The 'Commission for Modern Services at the Labor Market', called the 'Hartz Commission' for its leader Peter Hartz, had to develop a new concept for the service market, categorized as Hartz I through Hartz IV. Hartz IV in particular, the new ruling on unemployment benefits, stands heavily against classical social democratic values and will garner heavy criticism from traditional SPD voters."
 GER_sonderparteitag: "Sonderparteitag"
 GER_sonderparteitag_desc: "Since Lafontaine's withdrawal, Schröder's support among left-wing forces in Germany has been waning. Juggling the interests of employers and employees, of unions and corporations, of the economy and the working class has been controversial, to say the least. Gerhard Schröder, to save face, must now pass party leadership to fully focus on his office as Federal Chancellor."
 GER_vertrauensfrage: "Vertrauensfrage"
 GER_vertrauensfrage_desc: "Schröder has been unable to keep the Greens in line and his own SPD behind him. His primary way of enforcing his own policies has been to threaten his resignation and to thus threaten the remaining stability of the coalition. Now, with public support definitely gone, it is time to call a vote of confidence, a 'Vertrauensfrage'. Schröder fully intends to lose this vote and to call for immediate reelections."
 GER_schroeder_iii: "Schröder III"
 GER_schroeder_iii_desc: "The political power move has worked: Schröder secures his third term as Federal Chancellor and can now assemble a new coalition, either with the neoliberal FDP or the progressive Greens. Both the leftist PDS and the conservative CDU/CSU are unlikely to approve of this result and will continue hard-fought opposition to SPD policy."
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz: "Gewerkschaftsgesetz"
 GER_gewerkschaftsgesetz_desc: "The traditionally close relationship between the SPD and Germany's powerful labor unions will once more show itself with the passage of Schröder's Gewerkschaftsgesetz, a piece of legislation that will grant striking workers even greater autonomy and protection from the employer's attempts to cut strikes short. Critically, the law would pass almost all decisions as to strike ends to respective governments."
 GER_regions_of_innovation: "Regions of Innovation"
 GER_regions_of_innovation_desc: "Championed by the SPD electoral program of 2005, the Schröder government promised the reduction of bureaucracy and waiting periods as part of the 'Innovationsregionen' promise. These Regions of Innovation should greatly lessen the burden of daily life on the working class individual, even though a restriction of bureaucracy through spending cuts would likely bring conflict with the Greens."
 GER_trust_in_germany: "Trust in Germany"
 GER_trust_in_germany_desc: "The SPD aggressively led its reelection bid for Gerhard Schröder's third term as Federal Chancellor with the slogan \"Vertrauen in Deutschland\", 'Trust in Germany'. Playing to patriotic and communal feelings and connecting these energies with working class activism could be a real game winner for social democratic fervor - and for national unity against domestic and international obstacles."
 GER_further_union_reassurances: "Further Union Reassurances"
 GER_further_union_reassurances_desc: "After the successful passing of the Gewerkschaftsgesetz, the Schröder administration stands determined to forge a lasting and fruitful alliance with Germany's powerful labor unions, against international mega corporations and foreign investors."
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts: "Anti-Unemployment Efforts"
 GER_anti_unemployment_efforts_desc: "Unemployment, \"Arbeitslosigkeit\" in German, is one of the primary antagonists that the social democrats of the SPD seek to fight against. Built on the 'Regions of Innovation' program, the SPD leadership has now put forward a wide range of 'employment guarantee' policies that could push down the unemployment by as much as half a percent of the German population."
 GER_pan_european_efforts: "Pan-European Efforts"
 GER_pan_european_efforts_desc: "Although Schröder's advances to establish a European Confederation under Franco-German leadership all but irritated Paris, with the reestablished and newly strengthened social democratic leadership, it must be seriously considered whether or not another advance on the European ideal would be out of the question."
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions: "Close Ranks with the International Unions"
 GER_close_ranks_with_the_international_unions_desc: "After reestablishing the labor unions as the dominant force in German public life, Germany needs to take a dominant stance in international labor organizations to enforce high-quality labor standards across Europe and then the world. As long as there are cheaper labor pools in the EU, the living standards of the German working class are threatened."
 GER_economic_prosperity: "Economic Prosperity"
 GER_economic_prosperity_desc: "Growth! Growth! Growth!\nThe economy must groooooooow!"

 GER_return_to_old_social_democracy: "Return to Old Social Democracy"
 GER_return_to_old_social_democracy_desc: "If Willy Brandt was still alive, he'd rip Schröder's head off. The modern SPD has become too neoliberal, too friendly to megacorporations, and has drastically distanced itself from the working class. Some veterans of old school Social Democracy, like Helmut Schmidt and Oskar Lafontaine, are still around. Reintroducing themselves into politics might save the SPD after all."
 GER_brandtism: "Brandtism"
 GER_brandtism_desc: "Willy Brandt in the 1970s was a man of character: Worker-oriented, idealistic, anti-nationalistic, reformist, anti-communist. While a man like him will not be seen among German social democrats for another few centuries, returning to the roots of his philosophy is necessary to modernize a new and rejuvenated SPD."

 GER_european_leftism_desc: "Since the days Jean Jaures warned against a war between Europe's working peoples and died for it in 1914, the leftist movements across the continents have stood against nationalistic egomanias among the countries. We stand on the shoulders of giants - Jaures, Brandt, Schmidt, Walesa."

 GER_heavy_industry_focus: "Heavy Industry Focus"
 GER_heavy_industry_focus_desc: "East Germany's downfall was partially caused by the socialists' early focus on heavy industry, whereas West Germany built a dynamic service industry. Now, building on that service industry, we can at last unleash Germany's ambitions to a strong and proud heavy industrial sector."
 GER_continue_the_third_way: "Continue the Third Way"
 GER_continue_the_third_way_desc: "The 'Third Way', championed by the likes of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder, is a new style of social democracy. Liberal, pragmatic, business-oriented. Such a modernization was overdue and necessary to rescind the previous marxist leanings within European social democracy and bring it more in line with the American values of the Democratic Party as well as modern globalized neoliberals."
 GER_appeasement_in_eastern_europe: "Appeasement in Eastern Europe"
 GER_appeasement_in_eastern_europe_desc: "The Eastern Europeans, especially Poland and Ukraine, are REALLY annoyed with Nord Stream, as bypassing their pipelines gives the Russians leverage to blackmail Eastern European gas markets without threat of loss of Western European profits. We must make clear that, against this step backwards in our relations, we will stand firm with our commitments to our eastern partners."
 GER_non_aggression_principle_with_russia: "Non-Aggression Principle with Russia"
 GER_non_aggression_principle_with_russia_desc: "Between 1941 and 1945, Russia and Germany fought the most destructive conflict between any two nations in human history. Our two countries may never find themselves pitted against each other on the world's battlefields again."

That however does not mean we endorse Russian or Chinese authoritarians. Just stay out of our business, everybody. Germany will adopt a Swiss model of foreign policy."
 GER_angela_merkel: "Angela Merkel"
 GER_angela_merkel_desc: "With the lost Vertrauensfrage, Schröder's political capital and reputation with the German people was totally depleted. It was relatively easy for the conservative CDU/CSU, the 'Union', to pick up the pieces and sweep the election. Helmut Kohl's personal protegé, Angela Merkel, will be the main beneficiary. She will be the eighth Federal Chancellor of the FRG and the first woman to fill that post."
 GER_energy_reform: "Energy Reform"
 GER_energy_reform_desc: "The conservative Union opposed the Red-Green 'Atomkonsens' of 2000, in which the government decided to gradually shift away from nuclear energy in favor of renewables.

 GER_gesundheitspraemie: "Gesundheitsprämie"
 GER_gesundheitspraemie_desc: "A constantly popular talking point for conservative movements is the bloated nature of the budget. The Union, keenly aware of the German people's satisfaction with the healthcare program, attempted to reform its government budgeting by introducing a new kind of health tax, the 'Gesundheitsprämie'. It seeks to decrease the costs of employers and reshift them to the people in need of the service."
 GER_seek_centrist_compromises: "Seek Centrist Compromises"
 GER_seek_centrist_compromises_desc: "In order to secure power after Angela Merkel's election, the CDU should seek to establish a \"Grand Coalition\" between the Union and the SPD, the two largest parties. This would double up to assure limited conservative policy making and to isolate Gerhard Schröder. Schröder had humiliated himself after the election defeat and Angela Merkel would be able to assume the chancellorship with a clean sheet."
 GER_token_atomausstieg: "Token Atomausstieg"
 GER_token_atomausstieg_desc: "The 2005 Campaign had seen a pro-nuclear CDU/CSU pitted against the anti-nuclear SPD. The energy question will have to be solved to an unsatisfactory end for both sides in the coalition negotiations: The CDU/CSU will agree to an exit out of nuclear energy (German: \"Atomausstieg\") in the distant future, but the SPD will agree to not seek to accelerate the process beyond the Union's wishes."

Our shippings will reach every port in the world."
 GER_radicalize_german_conservatism: "Radicalize German Conservatism"
 GER_radicalize_german_conservatism_desc: "Merkel should refuse any coalition and lead a minority government against leftist opposition. The Union could do so with limited initial aid from the FDP, even though further assistance from right wing members among the Greens and the SPD would be required to actually get policy made. A politically somewhat unsuccessful term, it might be ideologically useful to position the Union as conservative hardliners."
 GER_military_spending_offensive: "Military Spending Offensive"
 GER_military_spending_offensive_desc: "Schröder's SPD was always very happy to cut defense spending, reasoning that the Cold War was over and that the money was more needed in the social safety net and the welfare state. The CDU/CSU was left concerned about reaching the 2%-goal provided by NATO to its member states, demanding that 2% of GDP should be in defense spending. Germany needs to hurry to meet that demand."
 GER_partial_autobahn_privatization: "Partial Autobahn Privatization"
 GER_partial_autobahn_privatization_desc: "The privatization of the German highway system, the 'Autobahn', remains a hot-button issue in German politics.

 GER_imperial_ambition: "Imperial Ambition"
 GER_imperial_ambition_desc: "While often blamed for the initial rise of German proto-fascist sentiment and often associated with the blind nationalistic fervor of the early 1910s, the German Empire of 1871 to 1918 marked an era of stability and prosperity that the rest of Europe at that time failed to replicate."
 GER_reestablish_local_thrones: "Reestablish Local Thrones"
 GER_reestablish_local_thrones_desc: "While the German people at large remain skeptical of the return of the monarchy, some individual states are not as reserved: Returning the royal families of Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hannover to their social positions, albeit as figureheads, should make the idea more likable to the more republican-minded parts of the German people. Let the boulevard press write about our own monarchs for once."
 GER_hohenzollern_restoration: "Hohenzollern Restoration"
 GER_hohenzollern_restoration_desc: "All preparations for constitutional changes are complete - the Federal Republic can be laid to rest, and a new constitutional monarchy can take its place.

In the background, we can then run the show with fewer obstacles."
 GER_national_ambition: "National Ambition"
 GER_national_ambition_desc: "Germany has one of the on a global cultural scale most infamous nationalisms of any country's history.

 GER_voelkisch_fervor: "Völkisch Fervor"
 GER_voelkisch_fervor_desc: "To reestablish a feeling of national superiority is to reaffirm a culture of bigotry and resentful stereotypes that built up and survived in a German culture in spite of its heavy cultural aversions to any form of nationalism and bigotry. The Italians are sleazy, the Polish are thieves, the Russians smell, the Arabs are rapists, the Jews want our money. Deutsche, wehrt euch!"
 GER_dismantle_democracy: "Dismantle Democracy"
 GER_dismantle_democracy_desc: "The ongoing national revolution has failed to catch the hearts of minds of many of Germany's population. Foreigners, intellectuals and the pro-European middle class have united in a socio-political block against our national resurgence.

Though it is unknown who was behind the attacks, it is likely that the attack was driven by racism, as 9 of the 12 injured persons were jews and almost all were foreigners."

 germany.18.t: "Joschka Fischer Signs The Volmer Erlass"
 germany.18.d: "The new decree named after Ludger Volmer (current Minister of State in our Foreign Affairs mninistry) seeks to reduce the long waiting lines to apply for a short-term visa (up to 3 months) and eliminate the illegal practices by foreign security forces to demand money for faster handling. Ludger Volmer was quite surprised when he read the headlines from the big German newspapers, that they named it after him, as he was at the time the decree got worked out stationed in a hospital for a needed treatment.\n\nThe decree encourages the employees in the embassies to accept visa applications, even if its not absolutely sure if the applicant really wants to return home after the visa expired.\n\nThe public mostly welcomed the decree with open arms, all ahead german companies, human rights organizations and politicians.\n\nOtto Schily, our minister of the interior, and some former high ranking politicians of the FDP spoke against it. They argue that this will encourage human trafficing and illegal immigration into our country."
 germany.18.a: "Welcome Them"
 germany.19.t: "Introduce the Travel Agency Procedure?"
 germany.19.d: "Head of the Reiseschutz AG, introduced a new travel insurance. The idea of a travel insurance is not new to Germany, the ADAC (German automobile club) has already offered this since 1995. More interesting however, that leading industrial figures and politicians came up with the idea to accept this and other similiar travel insurances as a proof of credit-worthiness which is needed to apply for a visa.\n\nThis coupled with the Volmer decree, could help us attract even more people to come to Germany on the short term.\n\nAlthought we noticed a slight increase in illegal activities, which are directly connected to the Volmer decree, we still have the public support to introduce this method."
 germany.19.a: "Go forward with the plan"
 germany.19.b: "I think we'll stick to cash.."
 germany.20.t: "Problems With The Reisebüroverfahren"
 germany.20.d: "The Reisebüroverfahren (travel agency process) was introduced during the last legislation period under Chancellor Kohl to tackle the evergrowing mafia-like groups which took advantage of the long waiting lines before the embassies. The applier can go to a registered travel agency where the agency takes over the job to apply for the visa.\n\nA travel agency in Neu-Ulm (and probably many others too) took advantage of this situation and sold made up travel trips to Germany. He collected the applications and sended them afterwards to the German embassy in Kiev. After the persons then entered Germany with a legal short-term visa, they simply dissapeared, traveled further to other European countries or started to work in dubious areas.\n\nWe hoped to fight illegal activities in front of our embassies, but it seems we just moved the problem to another region. The opposition parties now demand to scrap the Reisebüroverfahren."
 germany.20.a: "Scrap it"
 germany.20.b: "The positive effects are more important"
 germany.21.t: "Problems With The Volmer Decree"
 germany.21.d: "Our embassies report a massive increase over the last couple of months for applications of short-term visas, especially in easter Europe. It became normal to buy an travel insurance for as much as $1000, move into Germany and basically disappear afterwards. Experts already suggest that the only way to fix this problem is to revert it to statues quo as it originally was. The Volmer Erlass made life easier for some, but also encouraged illigal immigration, human trafficing and forced prostitution in a large style.\n\nAs that isnt already enough, the EU announced to look into this topic as its suspects the German government to break the Schengen Agreement and European law with this decree."
 germany.21.a: "It was wrong to introduce it in the first place"
 germany.21.b: "Now we keep it"
 germany.22.t: "EU Sues Germany Over The Volmer Erlass - Germany Loses"
 germany.22.d: "Germanies decision to keep the Volmer decree into action led to the decision by the EU to sue Germany over it. The European Union accused Germany to break our Schengen Agreement and European law in general.\n\nThe battle before the court lasted some months now but in the end, the European Court of Justice ruled that Germanies introduction of the decree broke existing law and thus forced us to take back the decree immediately."

 germany.24.d: "Lead by Rita Süssmuth the Süssmuth Commission worked out a paper, over the curse of a year, about the importance of immigration for Germany.

 germany.25.d: "The 'Ecotax' was a project from the green party B90/Grüne and meet many resistances, even from its coalition partner the CDU. As soon as it was introduced, the courts were flooded with constitutional lawsuits from the Association of Taxpayers, Associations of freight forwarders and the Association of cold stores. In a public action, the liberal party FDP paid the tax costs of all fuels at a fuel station in Berlin. 300 people could refuel this way for extremely cheap prices."
 germany.25.a: "Just because we increased the tax rate a little bit..."
 germany.26.t: "European Court Allows Women To Join The Bundeswehr"
 germany.26.d: "Our constitution from 1949 says explicitly that women are disallowed to serve in the German army. They were allowed to serve as nurses or in the military music service, but don't hold a weapon. As a consequence of that, 1996 a german woman sued the government as her application to join the army as a normal soldier got denied. The case got before the European Court and it has decided now that its against the law of the EU.\n\nThe German parliament needs to rewrite that paragraph of the constitution in the near future, but soon women can apply to join the army as equal soldiers."
 germany.26.a: "More hands to hold a weapon"
 germany.26.b: "I don't think so"

 germany.27.d: "The last leader of the German Democratic Republic and its ruling party SED, Egon Krenz, faces 6 1/2 years of prison time in Berlin-Hakenfelde. Krenz was in charge for just 49 days, but even in this last days people died from the force of the border guards. For these murders he got the sentence already in 1997, but thanks to his complaints and revisions before other courts he came free again after 18 days. This time, however, it seems he will remain long in the prison. Krenz still denies the accusations and says he's a victim of the winners justice now. Also, he denies any responsibility of West German courts for GDR citizens, but that won't help him now visiting his old comrades in prison."

 germany.28.t: "Vodafone Merges With Mannesmann AG"
 germany.28.d: "The Mannesmann AG is Germanies biggest cellular provider and started the privatisation of the German telecommunication market as D2. 1999 it bought one of its biggest concurrent in Europe, the British Orange company. As a reaction, the also British Vodafone GmbH announced to show interest in buying the Mannesmann AG for themselves, where it already holds around 30% of its share portion.\n\nVodafone offered in the original proposal 100 Billion Euro, later expanded that sum to 190 Billion. The Board of Directors of the Mannesmann already agreed to that proposal and soon Germanies biggest and one of its fastest-growing company will be split up and sold.\n\nThis process would be the first foreign takeover of an important German business and also the biggest in the world's history. Since back when the Mannesmann AG started its telecommunication business, another company called Telekom also joined the business area as a result of the German Post privatisation and grows quickly. If we want to stop this from happening, our last option would be to open an antitrust proceeding and stop the takeover from happening."
 germany.28.a: "Let them merge, we have the Telekom"
 germany.28.b: "We won't allow that"
 germany.29.t: "German Bahn cancelled Transrapid Route Between Hamburg And Berlin"
 germany.29.d: "The planned Transrapid route between Hamburg and Berlin would be Germanies and Europes first Transrapid route at all. 1994 the planning started for the 430km/h fast magnetic levitation train and in recent years a test route in Emsland was build. Financed was the project by a consortium of Thyssen, Siemens, Daimler-Benz and AEG.\n\nBesides the enormous sum of 5 Billion Euro to build it, activists protests against it because of noise pollution and possible environmental problems. Over the years the numbers of income for the route sunk together with its assumed passengers and thus the consortium decided to stop the project altogether, as the costs grew exponential, even with an almost finished planning."

Currently, the reason for this tragic accident is unknown, but a thorough investigation will tell us soon more.\n\nWhat makes this event even more tragic is that just 1 and a half year before the even worse train accident of Eschede happened, with 110 dead."

 ### CeBIT 2002 ### The CeBIT is Europes biggest telecommunication congress based in Hannover. This year the German chancellor Gerhard Schröder opened the congress together wuth his wife Doris Schröder.\n\nThis year it was allabout the new MMS function from [GER_mannesmann_yes_or_no] where you can send now messages like a SMS but with pictures instead. Another big topic is the build-up of UMTS as the next big step into the future for fast mobile internet connection. Again [GER_mannesmann_yes_or_no] seems to have a leap there as it announced in a big show the start of its new UMTS network in Germany.\n\nOn the sideline was the announcement of the new Microsoft Mira, a portable screen where you could work on it like at a PC.
 germany.33.t: "Joschka Fischer Visits Iran"
 germany.33.d: "Fischer meet in Teheran the Iranian President Mohammed Chatami and its Foreign Minister Kamal Charrasi to talk about the relationship between Germany and the Iran. This is the first visit of a German Foreign Minister in Iran for 9 years now, as the last years were overshadowed by the Assassination of Kurds in the Greek Mykonos restaurant in Berlin and the fake trial againt Helmut Hofer. Now that Iran released Hofer, it made way for a new try to normalize the relations between both countries again.\n\nIn a joint press report by Fischer and Charrasi, both said that theres now a new chance for the German-Iranian relationship and announced that the Iranian President will visit Germany soon. The content of the talk were mostly about the situation of human rights in Iran, but also how both countries can normalize there relationship again."

 germany.34.d: "Hofer is a German businessman who sold car parts to various contacts in Iran. As he visited Teheran in 1997 for the third time, he got arrested for illicit sex with a medical student. He indeed meets her in a hotel foyer, gave her his business card and offered her a free stay in Hamburg if she wants to come there. He told the judges that they didn't even kiss, but the sentence was death by stoning in the end, as the media in Iran demanded it. German lawyers could later revert the sentence to imprisonment.\n\nA year later the court resumes the trial against Hofer, again for illicit sex with a Muslim, but now also for espionage and insulting Iranian officials. Again with the help from his lawyers and German officials the charges got dropped and his imprisonment lifted.\n\nBefore the Iranian government could summon him back to court for another trial, the German ambassador organized a flight back to Germany where he arrived today. It seems the 3 year-long hell trip ended for Helmut Hofer."

Though the last 2 are pretty straight forward systems, players may end up being confused on the BfV system and how it works.\nWell how does it work?\n\n You can find the BfV button in the bottom right of your screen right above the Ledger, the BfV will allow you to control whether or not you want to play as radical parties. Pretty much to put it simply, if you have high funding on all 3 departments you will be a democracy with no issues, as the parties are all in check. Leaving funding at medium, will maintain a status quo. But if you have very low funding, then the department will start losing status points and will eventually fall apart, leading to a civil war (if you don't intervene). Specifically if Department 2 or 5 fall, a civil war will be under way. If Department 6 falls then there will other consequences. But once the civil war happens, you will need to win it and then you will be able to play as any of the 3 radical parties available.\n\nWe hope you enjoy,\n - The Millennium Dawn German-Rework Team."
