 Cheap_Labor: "Cheap Labor"
 Cheap_Labor_desc: "Born out of historical patterns of colonial exploitation and mass unskilled labor, India's workforce remains abundant and inexpensive. Though this labor surplus has spurred post-independence industrial growth, it continues to feed into a cycle of inequality and social unrest that puts national stability on shaky ground."
 RAJ_iri_fake_ns: "Highly Corrupt Military Industry"
 RAJ_iri_fake_ns_desc: "The complex legacy of India's License Raj era, characterized by heavy regulation and red tape, still lingers in the defense industry. While reforms in the 1990s opened doors for civilian industrial expansion, the military sector remains a web of corruption and inefficiency, traced back to opaque procurement processes and lack of accountability inherited from past decades."
 RAJ_re_fake_militar: "Highly Unorganized Military"
 RAJ_re_fake_militar_desc: "The shadow of India's Partition and the hastily organized military structures that followed linger over the armed forces. Coupled with bureaucratic inefficiencies and lack of modern coordination methods, this results in a disorganized military apparatus. However, these shortcomings make it apparent where improvement is most urgently needed, slightly reducing the resource drain of restructuring military doctrines."
 india_divided: "Indian Regionalism"
 india_divided_desc: "India's vast cultural and linguistic diversity, a legacy of its rich history and countless kingdoms, has often manifested as regionalism that complicates national governance. This mosaic of local interests has historically undermined centralized political power, making cohesive policy-making an arduous task. Yet, there exist various paths—both conciliatory and forceful—to navigate this complex landscape and potentially forge a more unified national identity."
 RAJ_gujarat_trouble_idea: "Gujarat Communal Unrest"
 RAJ_gujarat_trouble_idea_desc: "The communal tensions in Gujarat, a legacy of deep-rooted religious and ethnic divisions, have escalated into open conflict between Muslims and Hindus.

The Indian government restated its position, asserting that Aksai Chin is an integral part of India's sovereign territory. This reaffirmation comes as a resolute response to China's historical claims on the region. The Aksai Chin dispute has been a significant challenge in India-China relations, with both nations holding contrasting views on the territory's rightful ownership. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue continue, but a definitive resolution has remained elusive thus far. India's firm stance on its territorial claims underscores its commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and preserving the unity of its borders. The government remains open to constructive dialogue and peaceful negotiations to address the longstanding dispute and forge a way forward in the interest of regional stability and cooperation.

The territory has been a long-standing point of contention between India and China, leading to strained relations between the two countries. The Indian government's decision to relinquish claims on Aksai Chin comes as a bold step towards finding a peaceful resolution to the territorial dispute. While the region has been a contentious issue for decades, this surprising move reflects India's commitment to foster dialogue and de-escalate tensions with its neighboring nation. The withdrawal of claims on Aksai Chin aims to create an atmosphere conducive to constructive negotiations with China, with hopes for a mutually acceptable solution that respects the interests of both countries.

 indian_event.7.d: "India faced a combination of political and economic challenges in the new millennium, as the nation sought to navigate through a complex landscape and address pressing issues. The new millennium brought forth a range of hurdles that tested the resilience of India's democratic institutions and economic stability. On the political front, the country witnesses a fragmented political landscape marked by coalition governments and frequent changes in leadership. This created a certain degree of instability and hindered the implementation of crucial reforms. The absence of a clear majority in the central government made decision-making a challenging process, often requiring delicate negotiations with various regional and ideological partners. Economically, India struggled with persistent issues such as fiscal deficits, slow industrial growth, and unemployment. The economy faced hurdles in fully capitalizing on the reforms initiated in the 1990s, and certain sectors experienced sluggish growth. Structural challenges, bureaucratic red tape, and inadequate infrastructure hampered the ease of doing business and limited the country's potential for rapid economic expansion. Additionally, India witnessed the devastating impact of the dot-com bubble burst, which had ripple effects on the Indian information technology sector. Several IT companies faced setbacks as global markets experienced a downturn, leading to layoffs and financial strain within the industry. Amid these challenges, the government focused on policy measures to boost economic growth, attract foreign investments, and encourage entrepreneurship. Steps were taken to enhance infrastructure development, streamline regulations, and stimulate industrial activities. However, the impact of these initiatives took time to manifest and required sustained efforts to yield positive results. Despite the hurdles faced, India's resilience and democratic fabric remained intact. The country's vibrant civil society, independent judiciary, and free press played critical roles in ensuring accountability and promoting public discourse on vital issues."

 kasmir_war_decisions_category_desc: "The Kashmir conflict refers to a longstanding territorial dispute between India, Pakistan, and to some extent, China, over the region of Jammu and Kashmir. The conflict dates back to the partition of British India in 1947, which resulted in the creation of India and Pakistan as separate nations. The conflict in Kashmir has led to several wars, including the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1947-48, 1965, and 1999, as well as numerous border skirmishes and acts of insurgency. The dispute has resulted in the division of the region between India and Pakistan, with India administering the majority of Jammu and Kashmir, including the highly contentious Kashmir Valley, and Pakistan controlling a smaller portion known as Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.

However, it holds immense importance for both India and China in terms of strategic military control and access to resources. Border conflict on China-Indian border spans for decades.

Before US President's trip, the American intelligence community offered a chilling estimate: that the chance of a full-scale war between the two nuclear weapons powers was fifty-fifty in the next decade. US President was greeted like a rock star across India, with stops in Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, and Mumbai. He got a standing ovation addressing parliament. The crowds everywhere were enormous. Vajpayee returned the visit later that year with a state dinner in the White House. After decades of troubled ties, India and America had turned a corner."

 indian_event.45.d: "A suicide squad stormed India's parliament complex, killing seven people before dying themselves in an unprecedented attack on the seat of power of the world's biggest democracy. Witnesses said five people stormed the parliament, leaping from a car and attacking security guards after apparently driving into the complex using a fake pass. One of the intruders blew himself up at the main entrance to the parliament chambers. I heard a cracker-like sound near the entrance, then I saw people running helter-skelter, Kharbala Sain, a member of parliament, said outside the grand sandstone parliament, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens under British colonial rule. I saw many people firing at the same time. I couldn't make out who was who. I couldn't understand who the terrorists were and who the police were, said the MP. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the assault. One of the attackers died when he detonated explosives strapped to his waist. The Indian prime minister, who was not in the complex at the time, went on television to say that India's battle against terrorism had reached its final stage, while his defence and interior ministers vowed a tough response. The home minister, LK Advani, said: We will liquidate the terrorists and their sponsors whoever they are, wherever they are. Initial speculation turned to Islamist militants fighting Indian rule in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, where 38 people died in a suicide attack on the state assembly two months ago. If confirmed, it would raise tensions with Pakistan, accused by New Delhi of sponsoring Kashmiri militancy. President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan quickly condemned the attack and sent a message of sympathy to Mr Vajpayee."

 indian_event.47.d: "Coordinated groups of gunmen shot and blasted their way through tourist sites in the Indian financial center of Mumbai late Wednesday and early today, killing at least 101 people and wounding more than 200 while apparently targeting American and British citizens for use as hostages. The attackers swept through two luxury hotels favored by foreigners, the Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi, firing automatic weapons, throwing grenades and sending panicked guests scrambling for safety. Some guests were trapped inside the hotels for hours, even as a series of explosions set fire to the Taj hotel, a landmark along of Mumbai's waterfront. Although Mumbai has been the scene of several terrorist attacks in recent years, experts said Wednesday's assaults required a previously unseen degree of reconnaissance and planning. The scale and synchronization of the attacks pointed to the likely involvement of experienced commanders, some said, suggesting possible foreign involvement. Launching their attacks after dark, the terrorists struck almost simultaneously at the city's domestic airport and a railway station and sprayed gunfire at the Leopold Cafe, a restaurant popular with foreigners. As many as 16 groups hit nine sites on the southern flank of this crowded metropolis of 19 million"

The movement was named as one of the "Top 10 News Stories of 2011" by Time magazine. The movement gained momentum from 5 April 2011, when anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare began a hunger strike at the Jantar Mantar monument in New Delhi. The movement aimed to alleviate corruption in the Indian government through introduction of the Jan Lokpal Bill. Another aim, which was led by Ramdev, Kiran Bedi, Arvind Kejriwal and others was the repatriation of black money from foreign banks. Mass protesters focussed on legal and political issues, including political corruption, kleptocracy, and other forms of corruption. The movement was primarily one of non-violent civil resistance and was composed of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, hunger strikes, and rallies, and the use of social media to organise, communicate, and raise awareness. The protests were nonpartisan and most protesters were hostile to political parties' attempts to use them to strengthen their own political agenda."

The attack killed 40 Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel as well as the perpetrator—Adil Ahmad Dar—who was a local Kashmiri youth from the Pulwama district. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist group, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India blamed neighbouring Pakistan for the attack, while the latter condemned the attack and denied having any connections to it. The attack dealt a severe blow to India-Pakistan relations, consequently resulting in the 2019 India-Pakistan military standoff. Subsequently, Indian investigations identified 19 accused"
