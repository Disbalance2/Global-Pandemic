 #### Ukraine Events

 ukraine_news.1.t2: "The Ukrainian People's Reform Fails!"
 ukraine_news.1.d1: "Over the last several months [UKR.GetLeader] and the Verkhovna Rada have held a referendum to begin to empower the president and establish a new upper chamber. The status of the referendum is regardless still questionable; however, it is more than a step in the right direction for the Ukrainian people. The referendum reduces the members of parliament from 450 to 300, improves the powers of the president, and establishes a two-chamber parliament."
 ukraine_news.1.d2: "In other news, a recent referendum in Ukraine has failed by sweeping margins. The people of Ukraine have decided it is not in the best interest to empower President [UKR.GetLeader], and the reduction of the parliamentary seats."
 ukraine_news.1.a: "Interesting"

 ukraine_news.2.t: "Referendum Results Implementation"
 ukraine_news.2.d: "As planned, the Verkhovna Rada will proceed to the implementation of the popular will. The voting will take place very soon. But now, there are discussions between the leaders of various parties about the introduction of amendments to the draft law, which will not only deprive deputies of inviolability and create a two-chamber parliament but at the same time increase the role and strength of the country's president."

 ukraine_news.2.a: "We can always negotiate..."
 ukraine_debates.1.t: "Demand for Political Support"

 ukraine_debates.2.b: "We cannot accept these conditions!"
 ukraine_debates.3.t: "Dangerous Pollution"
 ukraine_debates.3.d: "The green parties within Ukraine have started to voice their worries to the public. They speak in large forums in every Oblast.

Some say that such a decision can significantly empower the president. Others, on the contrary, look at innovation as the path to a parliamentary and democratic republic. But who will be right?

 ukraine_md.1.a: "Day of Victory!"

 ### Law failed
 ukraine_md.2.t: "People have refused!"
 ukraine_md.2.d: "Despite the backroom negotiations, the parties could not agree on the law.

 ###Revolution Events
 ukraine_revolution.0.t: "New Mechanics for Ukraine"
 ukraine_revolution.0.d: "Ukraine is an interesting country to play as in the timeline of Millennium Dawn. However, there are some important notes to consider when playing through the tree.\n\nThere are two main variables/counters that are extremely important to Ukraine:Stability of Regime (SOR for short) and Chance of Revolt (COR for short).\n\n Stability of Regime (SOR) is different from the normal stability at the top of the screen. It is entirely unique to Ukraine and is meant to mock the progression over the next 5-10 years transition towards the eventual war in the Donbas. Most effects in the focus tree and events in general will make use of this new mechanic in the effort to integrate decisions much heavier into the tree and the players playstyle. You can use this as a style of 'currency' in the fashion you can utilize it to lower the Chance of Revolt counter.\n\nChance of Revolt on the otherhand displays just that. Once you reach 15 a mission will trigger that can cause the war in the Donbas. It is important to attempt to maintain this variable as much as you can or else you may have a civil war on your hands.\n\nYou can always retrigger this event in the Stability of Ukraine decisions.\n"
