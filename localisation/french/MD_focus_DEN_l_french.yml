 DEN_refurbish_royal_naval_academy_desc: "At an age of more than 3 years, the Royal Danish Naval Academy has the honor of being the oldest still-existing officers' academy in the world.

 DEN_establish_OPLOG_KOR_desc: "OPLOG KOR, short for Operative Logistical Support Korsør, is the local support infrastructure for our naval base in Korsør, FLS KOR.

 DEN_early_fighter_models: "Early Fighter Models"

 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base_desc: "Our air base near Roskilde was previously armed with NIKE rockets and HAWK batteries that contributed massively to our anti-air capabilities on Zealand and whose prime directive was the protection of Copenhagen from air bombardments.

 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production: "Streamline the Aircraft Production"
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production_desc: "Several of our advisors have recommended that we bring the production of aircraft for the Air Force home.

 DEN_outlaw_hijab_desc: "For some time now, patriots have voiced their concern that some women - mainly immigrants - are wearing what is widely considered a symbol of religious oppression so openly in our society. They claim that it is 'their own choice' but isn't that exactly what somebody who was forced to wear it would say? Regardless it certainly is very far from Danish culture. We should probably ban it before it spreads."
 DEN_antagonize_scandinavians: "Antagonize Scandinavia"
 DEN_antagonize_scandinavians_desc: "Denmark has always been the greatest power of Scandinavia. We do not concern ourselves with the scattered mountain monkeys of Norway or the politically correct eunuchs of Sweden - in fact, we enjoy ridiculing them and making jokes at their expense."

 DEN_revive_folk_high_school_movement_desc: "The Folk School Movement started as an attempt to bring the values of Danish culture to every man and woman willing to attend - a truly noble goal, and one that should be not only preserved but expanded upon! An expanded system of folk high schools will make it possible to rally around the true Danish culture."
 DEN_venerate_country: "The Country"
 DEN_venerate_country_desc: "It's time to rally to the true foundation of our Danish culture - the country.

Let us rally to Denmark, our fatherland!"
 DEN_venerate_values: "The Values"
 DEN_venerate_values_desc: "It's time to rally to the true foundation of our Danish culture - the values. A Dane is a Dane no matter where in the world he is.

 DEN_venerate_queen: "The Queen"
 DEN_venerate_queen_desc: "It's time to rally to the true foundation of our Danish culture - the Queen. Not only can our royal House can trace its roots back to the first kings of Europe, but the Queen herself exudes grace and nobility. Criticized by few, beloved by all, she is the living embodiment of Danish culture and should be treated as such."
 DEN_border_control: "Introduce Border Control"
 DEN_border_control_desc: "Our party member has for some time now demanded that the government view illegal immigration as the prime evil threatening our society today. As we have recently experienced a surge in support for our cause, perhaps now the machinery of politics will work for us. We may even want to fortify the border militarily to get the point across - after all, our supporters do love a show of force."
 DEN_expand_police_force: "Expand the Police Force"
 DEN_expand_police_force_desc: "It is simply intolerable that, as the world heats up, we simultaneously have to fight a domestic enemy in the form of crime - whether organized or enabled by border-hopping gangs of thieves. We must at once let the police chiefs know that whatever they need we're willing to grant it. Our people must be able to sleep safely in their beds at night!"

 DEN_abolish_section_19_desc: "Section 19 of the Danish Constitution states that the king (or queen) cannot take any action of potential political ramifications or that are 'large in general' without agreement from the Folketing. This foolish restriction shall no more hamper our Queen in her everyday meetings with heads of state from around the world. Let us stop treating her like a child needing supervision and instead trust in her to do good."
 DEN_restrict_greenlandic_autonomy: "Restrict Greenlandic Autonomy"
 DEN_restrict_greenlandic_autonomy_desc: "The Greenlanders have time and time again shown that their incompetence is simply too great to allow them any degree of self-rule.

 DEN_draft_new_constitution: "Draft a New Constitution"
 DEN_draft_new_constitution_desc: "In addition to being graceful nobility, the Queen has turned out to also be a shrewd and intelligent political mind. She has already made clear that she is more than capable of ruling the country that is hers by birthright and many voices are now demanding that we make it official. However, that would require changing large parts of the Constitution - perhaps it would be easier to draft a new one altogether."

 DEN_state_atheism_desc: "The nationalists have been chased underground, the Queen has been banished and the Church of Denmark has been dismantled - we must ensure that none of these three archaic concepts of 'God, Queen and Country' ever return in any shape or form.

 DEN_empower_hizb_ut-Tahrir: "Empower Hizb ut-Tahrir"
 DEN_empower_hizb_ut-Tahrir_desc: "It seems our people have been quite smitten with the islamic preachings. The public support for an islamist state is now large enough that the pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir has been pushing for real political influence. We should grant them the power they need to usher in this new caliphate of theirs."
 DEN_arabian_allies: "Arabian Allies"
 DEN_arabian_allies_desc: "Historically, there's not really a lot of Islamic history in Scandinavia and our newly founded emirate is diplomatically very isolated. Let's reach out to our fellow muslim countries in the Arab League and forge new political bonds."

 DEN_peaceful_revolution_desc: "Our revolution needs not be a bloody one - by emphasizing the democratic aspects of socialism we may encourage our supporters to encourage voting rather than shooting their way to the revolution. Let us make our revolution a peaceful one."
 DEN_raise_unemployment_benefits: "Raise Unemployment Benefits"
 DEN_raise_unemployment_benefits_desc: "The downtrotten and unemployed are usually a target whenever somebody needs to be blamed for a downturn in the economy. We, however, recognize that being unemployed does not make you less of a citizen than your neighbour."

 DEN_new_foreign_policy: "New Foreign Policy"
 DEN_new_foreign_policy_desc: "Denmark is often treated as a junior member of the international society, punching above our weight. Things haven't always been that way, though.

We can be that way again, we WILL be that way again!"

The Liberals seem poised to take the lead and become the largest political party on the right, if not overall, and though in reality this will most likely merely mean cuts to the funding of the welfare state, rather than outright dismantlement, it is being viewed as a minarchist declaration of war on the Nordic Model."

These usually disparate groups have been united in a common belief in the superiority of the nation of [DEN.GetName] to all other nations in the world, and a strong belief that the new [DEN.GetName] should right the many wrongs that the world has inflicted on the nation throughout the [DEN.GetAdjective] history.\n\nThe rhetoric of these groups are already cause for concern for several of the neighbours of [DEN.GetName], who, historically, the [DEN.GetAdjective] have plenty of reasons to carry a grudge against."

As it turns out, a large number of coalition members were fighting for religion rather than against it and at a recent meetingin the Revolutionary Committee arguments were made about islamism as a revolutionary ideology. To the surprise of many, the hardliner left-wingers were outnumbered and the meeting concluded with the expulsion of the self-declared atheists.

The answer became known today as Queen Margrethe II announced that she will be abdicating the throne and moving with her family to Great Britain where the British monarch has already offered the royal family permanent residence at Windsor Castle. Shortly after Queen Margrethe's annoucement the growing far-left coalition in Denmark has stated their intentions to abolish the Danish Crown.

Among the most widespread worry was that this would culminate in a bloody revolutionary purge similar to those of the early years of the Soviet Union. This fear seems to have been averted as it turns out that the forces of democratic socialism have won the internal power struggle and have assumed the mantle of the revolution arguing that freedom cannot come to the people through undemocratic means. Political commentators are describing this as a 'bloodless revolution' as the battered country collectively draws a sigh of relief.\n"

Today it is clear that the hardliners calling for armed insurrection won and reports are already coming in of violent assaults on bankers and politicians in Copenhagen. Meanwhile the moderate voices in the Revolutionary Committee are reported missing, rumoured to be either dead or in hiding. One political commentator bitterly remarked that it seems the revolution is destined to be a bloody one and only time will tell whether it will be worth it in the end."
