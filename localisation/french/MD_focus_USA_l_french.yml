 USA_teddys_legacy: "Teddy's Legacy"
 USA_teddys_legacy_desc: "Speak softly and carry a big stick. These were the ways of Teddy \"Rough Riding\" Roosevelt himself. A man of simple principles, he looked to better not only the homeland but the world itself. He used intimidation not as a way to solely seek power, but as a way of mediation from the gross negligence of human nature as we know it. Though his own hubris would cost him the ability to preemptively intervene in the Great War, ending a conflict so grand in scale that apparently we had to lead ourselves down the path of yet another one.

 USA_increasing_working_class_power: "Increase Working Class Power"
 USA_increasing_working_class_power_desc: "The majority of this nations' people believe they don't have a voice. This has caused an apathy crisis which previous administrations have capitalized on to hold their power. Through awareness campaigns, grass roots movements and strategic national holidays we can give the people the time they need, the voice they want and of course the motivation they deserve. In a democracy, voting is force itself, the supreme authority which is exercised against the realities of human weakness in character and care for its fellow members."

 USA_private_ownership_act: "Private Ownership Act"
 USA_private_ownership_act_desc: "The oxymoron that is the Private Ownership Act is one which will change the economic precedent of the nation.

 USA_department_of_economic_management_desc: "The DoEM will be a government oversight department in helping to understand, regulate and look to implement true public ownership into our Socialist society. Now while we preach the words of Marx, we also look to those more well rounded in their thinking. We look to Robert Owens and his ethical Socialism, or as marx himself called it \"Utopian\" Socialism. But we look for inspiration from the Market Socialist as well, we will decommoditize housing and slowly understand the true basic needs of the modern people. From there we will reform the markets of the wants for those who can earn and of course make it."
 USA_national_unions_act: "The National Unions Act"
 USA_national_unions_act_desc: "The unions of the nation are scattered among their own infighting. We must unite them under a national entity, we must seek out the rabblerousers within these smaller unions, crush them, and unite them under the common national goal.

We must be a new Socialist society, one which focuses on the public, their needs and the ability to create a unity in belief and understanding of cause."
 USA_political_science_reforms: "Political Science Reforms"
 USA_political_science_reforms_desc: "The ideas of politics and ideology are so confused in this supposed \"post truth\" era we live in that we must set a real standard of rationality and reason. Our scientific community with help through state mandated funding will be used to create templates of approaching sensitive subjects. The conscept of an ideology for example, an ideology is a well rounded set of beliefs stretching from both economic and social backgrounds. With this we can tell that ideologies are not left or right, but rather subjective to the individuals combined beliefs. As such the old distinction of left and right, one which was originally used to determine ones standing on economics is completely defunct in this new age of cutural and societal change as a whole. Technology in itself is a big fault for the confusion and as such we must help to better research, understand and implement new discoveries as a whole."
 USA_department_of_state_security: "Department Of State Security"
 USA_department_of_state_security_desc: "The DoSS will be a joint federal oversight commission which will unite the different state security branches we have within the nation. These different branches all have their own goals and fight with each other over the importance of either domestic or foreign happenings. We must put an end to this factionalism and have a united policy in approaching both sides of this coin. Formost to defend the public we must focus on the domestic issues, but to strengthen our domestic approach is to understand foreign incursions against us. We must defend our society from those who wish to strip it limb by limb from us."
 USA_socialist_militarism: "Socialist Militarism"
 USA_socialist_militarism_desc: "The militarism of the nation has always been used for imperialist reasoning. Exploiting nations for their resources by using our military in either direct means like in iraq, or by indirect means through our extensive military base apparatus is what makes the world hate us. We must slowly decommission and retrain the modern soldier. One who understands the true values that they serve the public, the cause of Socialism, the cause of a just, fairer world. We will mobilize the public so they can fight for their cause and it is the state who will help lead them on their journey."

 USA_appeasing_rising_commissars: "Appeasing Rising Commissars"
 USA_appeasing_rising_commissars_desc: "The retooling and retraining of values of our armed services has unfortunately led to the reality that even faced the old order.

 USA_appeasing_trotskyist: "Appeasing Trotskyist"
 USA_appeasing_trotskyist_desc: "The coalition has always been plagued with a strong wing of trotskyist, these radicals seek to undermine our ability to sell the values of Socialism by looking to enforce a world revolution mentality. Its this same hubris which cost the Soviets to lose the Polish Soviet War of 1921. We must create targeted language to issues that matter to them, specifically funding in security measures to boost our foreign presence.

 USA_appeasing_the_anarchist_society_desc: "The Anarchist Society is a strong wing of the Socialist coalition party we hold onto.

 ##Anarchist Faction Path
 USA_weaking_global_economics: "Weakening Global Economics"
 USA_weaking_global_economics_desc: "Through the stylistic wording of protectionism we will actually be planning our decoupling from the global market. Protectionism gives people the notion they can still trade and exploit us, however we know better. Our Anarchist economics will ensure that domestic supply chains are met by domestic means. This will sure have some push pull effect overall economically speaking. But remember, slow and steady wins the race, and I think we've been moving slow enough."
 USA_the_communes_act: "The Communes Act"
 USA_the_communes_act_desc: "The Communes Act is legislation set forth to spread out and decentralize the urban centers. This will be a slow process, but the idea is to, in a way, slowly de-industrialize and return people to the vast lands which we have as a nation. These new communes can work in conjunction with already established townships and villages near their area. This will reduce the government oversight of needed services which weakens the hold the government has as well, while still stregthening the domestic defense ideal of the nation."
 USA_communal_hospitals_act: "The Communal Hospitals Act"
 USA_communal_hospitals_act_desc: "The C.H.A. is a congressional bill passed to give more medical freedom to local doctors and medically inclined persons to be able to take initiative and organize local heathcare facilities. These local or Communal Hospitals will be able to care for the needs of those in their area. This should reduce the need for certain federal mandated programs and allow for localized communes to share in the caring for one another's sickly as the needs may arise."

 USA_revolutionary_integrity_desc: "The people of the nation are vastly diverse...this is a problem if we are to move forward with the revolution.

 USA_strengthening_officer_influence_desc: "The military is the driving force to defend the ideals of the nation, the people, the cause....

We may reduce the our monthly pool, but remember, quality is just as good as quantity."

 USA_expansion_of_jrotc_programs_desc: "They're doing their part, are you. The red services of the nation need you and you can get early and free experience today by joining the many Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs in your school today. Funding will be directed into the schooling system to instill duty, honor and pride into the youth of this nation. We will show them the cause for which their fathers, brothers, mothers have joined up for. We will show them the ways of the true revolutionary, they will truly want to know more."

 USA_where_are_my_dice: "Where Are My Dice?"
 USA_where_are_my_dice_desc: "The states are wildly unpredictable when it comes to gambling and similar institutions. While some see exploitation we see economic incentives. Federal standards will be created towards such industries in the manner that there shall be little to no abolishment of such. While this may irritate the more faith based voters, in the grander scheme of things it will be looked on as a net positive."
 USA_encourage_organ_donors: "Encouraging Organ Donors"
 USA_encourage_organ_donors_desc: "The black market for organs shows a clear dis-interest in the markets of organ replacements for even those who need it.

 USA_personal_policing_desc: "Law enforcement has always been a government monopoly, but where the police are at helping to protect and serve there are at least a dozen or so other areas where they aren't. As such we must deregulate personal gun ownership and reform the ideas and possibilities of personal policing. Many may find this distasteful at first given the indoctrination of the media, but in due time many more will see that the good guy with a gun can as helpful as the folks in blue have been."
 USA_reducing_welfare_burdens: "Reducing Welfare Burdens"
 USA_reducing_welfare_burdens_desc: "Social Security is a program that is expected to become insolvent by 2040 and that date closes towards us as we progress forward towards it as well.

 USA_political_Fairness_act_desc: "The PFA is a bill which will create a federal standard in regards to 3rd party involvement in congressional elections. A minimum requirement is that a 3rd party must have at least 1% voter registration of the voting population. This will also come with organizing each party's coverage by media outlets in order to follow their primaries and eventual candidate race members as to create a balanced coverage of all participating parties in the elections."
 USA_federal_elections_act: "The Federal Elections Act"
 USA_federal_elections_act_desc: "The FEA is critical legislation that has been needed in America since the creation of the duopoly. By enforcing voting reforms and availability the masses can now vote more efficiently and effectively. On top of that, 3rd Party candidates will be able to run for the presidency by following the same principles of the Political Fairness Act, the main difference is the requirements are now for the national voting body instead of the state by state requirement for the congressional elections. With this in mind many have begun to celebrate the Reforms that the nation has completed as with new ideas and growing means of compromising the American Eagle will soar once more."
 USA_expanded_mental_healthcare: "The Expanded Mentalcare Act"
 USA_expanded_mental_healthcare_desc: "Mental healthcare is an often neglected aspect of the larger picture of health for individuals. Insurance policies often do not cover it, and many American citizens must pay out of pocket for this care. The Expanded Mentalcare Act aims to solve these issues, assuage the insurance companies' costs, and work the charge into the federal government's budget. This new act brings the cost from the companies, the common person, and the provider to be federally regulated, ensuring quality mental healthcare for every American citizen."

 USA_gun_regulations_mechanic_category: "Gun Violence Crisis"
 USA_gun_regulations_mechanic_category_desc: "America is suffering from a unique epidemic that no other country is. Its cause stems from the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America - The Right to Bear Arms. Its clear intent and purpose has slowly degraded as time has passed, and as we enter the new millennium, it may be time to re-evaluate its usefulness. The number of mass shootings continues to rise year after year, and it is clear that some sort of action must be taken.\n\nThis mechanic covers the rising mass shooting events within the United States and the problems resulting from the federal government's neglect and inaction. There are several ways to assuage the issues from gun violence, which are unlocked based on your choice on the gun control debate. Mechanically, two new modifiers are concerned with the §YLikelihood of Mass Shooting Events§! and the §YPercentage of Casualties Amount§!. As it is written, the former handles the likelihood that generic mass shooting events fire or can outright prevent major mass shooting events from occurring. The latter, the §YPercentage of Casualties Amount§!, happens when a mass shooting occurs. It increases or decreases the number of casualties based on whether you regulate the number of firearms and the type of firearms available at large to the civilian populace.\n\n§YLikelihood of Events§!: [?USA_frequency_percentage_for_gun_violence|%2]\n§YPercentage of Casaulties Amount§!: [?USA_casualties_percentage_for_gun_violence|%2]"

 USA_enact_red_flag_laws_federally: "Person-in-Crisis Laws"
 USA_enact_red_flag_laws_federally_desc: "Person-in-Crisis Laws mimic several proposed state amendments to gun rights. These proposed federal laws include red flag laws, which help pinpoint people at a higher likelihood of committing gun violence and prevent them from owning firearms. The proposed laws would look at medical histories, testimony from family and friends, and much more to understand whether a person should have the right to own a firearm."
 USA_enact_universal_background_checks_federally: "Limitations on Gun Owners Act"
 USA_enact_universal_background_checks_federally_desc: "The Limitations on Gun Owners Act is a left-lead act that would help implement nationwide requirements on background checks regardless of the point of sale, ending the private transfer loophole, and much more to help limit the number of gun owners there are in the states. It, paired with other laws, should help reduce the frequency of mass shooting events."
 USA_limitations_on_the_firearms_sold_federally: "Restriction of Assault Weapons Act"
 USA_limitations_on_the_firearms_sold_federally_desc: "The Restriction of Assault Weapons Act is the latest in new gun control legislation. It rehashes the expired federal ban on Assault Weapons. It establishes the provisions as permanent bans to help minimize the firearms available to the general public that could be used in mass casualty events. It is a new precedent in American history severely limiting the number of firearms available to law-abiding citizens; however, this is needed to keep America safe and free from the abuses of firearms."
 USA_require_licensing_for_firearms_federally: "National Register of Firearm Owners"
 USA_require_licensing_for_firearms_federally_desc: "Several states in the United States have already implemented licensing requirements within their state. Gun control activists are campaigning for a National Register of Firearm Owners to create a federal database of all registered firearm owners. The National Register houses information that includes training, licensing of the owner, and proper registration of firearms owned by the licensed individual. The register should keep registered owners on track with annual training checks, renewals, and more while providing the United States federal government revenue."
 USA_government_buyback_program_federally: "Federal Buyback Program"
 USA_government_buyback_program_federally_desc: "Due to legislative changes and a lack of turnover from the private owners of firearms in the States, the federal government is offering a firearm buyback program. The program is intended to help remove firearms that are deemed no longer street legal and bring them under the care of law enforcement and other government bodies. The program's cost is high, but it should reduce the frequency of mass shooting events and the number of casualties."
 USA_arm_the_teachers_with_pistols_federally: "Government-Sponsored Armed Professionals"
 USA_arm_the_teachers_with_pistols_federally_desc: "To increase security at schools while not compromising the rights of the common folk, the federal government is considering sponsoring teachers, staff, working professionals, and otherwise to receive firearm and firearm training. The idea is that the training individual will be able to respond quickly to a threat while in an active shooter situation. Immediate effects from the policy change would see more deterrence from would-be domestic terrorists; however, arming more people could turn places such as schools into an old Western shootout."
 USA_more_police_in_schools_federally: "Establish the Agency of Federal School Policing"
 USA_more_police_in_schools_federally_desc: "The majority of police forces have historically been in charge of the states. It is uncommon for the federal government to interfere with police jurisdictions unless it directly compromises the federal government's interests. The recent rise in mass shootings is catching the eye of the federal government, and it is considering establishing the so-called Agency of Federal School Policing to assist in combatting the rise in mass shootings. The agency will work to post police officers in schools and other academic sites to increase security and thwart any would-be attacker."
 USA_school_based_militias_federally: "Conscript Localities Act"
 USA_school_based_militias_federally_desc: "Some gun activists advocate for introducing locally sourced militias to defend important locations and schools from would-be attackers. The theory cites the opening line of the Second Amendment. \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" The people will regulate their local militia in the hopes of securing important areas and defending the places should anyone come to attack the area."
 USA_repeal_the_brady_law: "Repeal the Brady Law"
 USA_repeal_the_brady_law_desc: "The Brady Law is a law that mandated federal background checks on firearm purchases and imposed a five-day waiting period on firearm purchases. The waiting period was removed with implementing a computerized system in 1998. Repealing the Brady Law would remove the requirements for federal background checks and allow easier access to firearms for the general populace."
 USA_remove_full_automatic_reagan_ban: "Repeal the Hughes Amendment"
 USA_remove_full_automatic_reagan_ban_desc: "President Ronald Reagan signed the Hughes Amendment into law in 1986. It loosened a fair number of gun regulations, such as no longer requiring records of non-armor piercing ammo purchases and banning the civilian transfer or ownership of fully automatic weapons (machine guns). Although the majority of the amendment was regarding loosening regulations, repealing this amendment would allow the civilian populace to own fully automatic weapons once more."
 USA_limited_person_in_crisis_laws_federally: "Persons-in-Danger Act"
 USA_limited_person_in_crisis_laws_federally_desc: "The proposed Persons-in-Crisis laws remove too many freedoms from our people. We have compromised with our friends across both sides of the aisle, looking at a measure that could solve some of the issues illustrated without infringing on the rights of the people. We have called it the Persons-in-Danger Act to show the bipartisan effort of establishing such a set of laws. The key difference is that restrictions preventing a person from owning a gun would be much laxer than the more aggressive Person-in-Crisis laws. "
 USA_limited_background_checks_federally: "Limited Background Checks on Gun Owners Bill"
 USA_limited_background_checks_federally_desc: "Another compromise on the floor of Congress is brewing. The proposed background checks from the other side of the bed are too rigorous. Relaxing some sections of the regulations but establishing background checks should help prevent more mass shooting events. The Limited Background Checks on Gun Owners Bill should address some of these concerns and allow us to move forward into a new tomorrow."

While some say their views are right and others argue against saying no its their views which are right. The reality is there is no real or earnestly clear answer. The complexities of such a geographically and demographically diverse nation will always create pitfalls and horizons for many. The best one can hope is that the stauch \"my way\" based \"solutions\" end up helping more than they hurt. Despite the last administration's budget surplus many still see the ballooning spending rates in healthcare, the rising welfare spending and so on as a growing concern along with economic volatility creating uncertainty in the dollar's value itself. If congress can't get the deficit spending under control there may be turbulent times ahead. Alas only time and congress shall be able to tell that."

But instead looking to reinvest back into the economy and the citizens of these United States."
 USA_american_tax_code: "American Tax Code"
 USA_american_tax_code_desc: "The tax code of the United States is one which is both hated and loathed by many. With the same energy in the same sentence, politicians have brought about and taken away change which has not only affected millions of Americans but also few Americans as well. The modern discontent with the Internal Revenue Service and the overall makeup of the tax code itself has been a very sensitive subject for the average American. But with the new Millennia comes new bills, and new bills mean new changes...the only hope is that those changes are good, rather than worse."

Traditionalist thinking where the news was supposed to be strictly non-politically oriented when addressing topics of the day, and then there were the activist camp. Modern thinking where the news through opinion pieces could be used to get the word out on issues that mattered, to spread awareness and so forth.

 usa_vanilla.41.t: "Representatives Speaks Passionately in the House"
 usa_vanilla.41.desc: "Asked about her stance on a number of policy issues at a fund-raising dinner, a representative spoke out in support of President [USA.GetLeader]'s policies. She further claimed that many of her fellow representatives had similar views, but were merely held back by \"idiotic short-sightedness, thinking no further than the next election\" instead of doing what was right for the American people. \n\nHer comments have been widely reported by the press and put several of her colleagues in hot water as they had to explain where they stood on these issues."
 usa_vanilla.41.a: "She is right, you know."
 usa_vanilla.42.t: "Senator Voices Opposition Towards Recent Policy"
 usa_vanilla.42.desc: "A Senator has given an interview in a major newspaper, saying that he can no longer support the \"foolish and dangerous\" policies of President [USA.GetLeader].

 usa_vanilla.43.desc: "During a recent debate on tax reform, a Representative launched into a long-winded speech about the many failings of the Administration. According to him, no right-thinking American could possibly want to support the policies of the President, whatever their party affiliation may be. \n\nHis harsh words seem to have had an effect, as a number of Representatives previously thought firmly behind the policies of [USA.GetLeader] made noises of support."

While technically only one man with one vote, Washington insiders nonetheless counted him as worth several votes as he was the key to secure several others. \n\nWith the seat most likely going to an avowed critic of President [USA.GetLeader], the Administration will find it a lot harder to secure the necessary votes to pass bills."

 USA_american_economic_decisions_category_desc: "The American economy is the world's largest and one of the strongest economies in the world. However, that does not mean it doesn't have its weaknesses. It is mainly service based as the majority of American businesses look elsewhere for cheaper labor. The economy is also tied-in very closely with American politics. Conducting business in America is expensive but extremely profitable. §YWall Street§! is also partially to blame. The businessmen and women in New York are some of the most powerful individuals in America. It is best to keep them in check and on the governments good side or else.\n\n§YStrength of Wall Street:§!

 #Asteroid Mining Event Chain
 donald_trump.8.t: "Launching the Asteroid Mining Initiative"
 donald_trump.8.d: "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an Asteroid Mining Initiative, or AMI, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the United States, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small. Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."
 donald_trump.8.o1: "Just need to wait for an asteroid..."

 donald_trump.9.t: "Asteroid Spotted"
 donald_trump.9.d: "Recently, our scientists at NASA spotted a suitable asteroid passing near Earth. This has been a relief for the AMI, as some doubted if we'd actually ever spot a suitable, economical asteroid at all. However, this asteroid is moving slowly enough, is large enough, and is rich enough to be moved into orbit and mined. The asteroid is, in-fact, larger than the state of New York. The next step is simply to move this asteroid into orbit around Earth, which has never been done before. In the meantime, NASA engineers, and even private enterprises like SpaceX, have invented mechanisms to mine the asteroid, so they will be ready by the time the asteroid gets into orbit."
 donald_trump.9.o1: "Let's get that baby into orbit"

 donald_trump.10.t: "Asteroid in Orbit"
 donald_trump.10.d: "With the asteroid in orbit, NASA and SpaceX are both sending missions to the orbiting asteroid. NASA is mainly concerned about collecting scientific data, while SpaceX is more concerned about mining the material. No doubt this is a noteworthy achievement, which gives us an edge in space. There is even talk about bringing in more asteroids, but many say that additional asteroids can come later, as this asteroid is very large and well suited for mining. Other countries are already looking at us with envy, and are considering their own asteroid mining programs. The costs are extremely high even to develop the technology to even get there, so there is little worry among SpaceX or NASA that competition will arive."
 donald_trump.10.o1: "Mining shall begin"

 donald_trump.11.t: "Profits from Mining Start Pouring in"
 donald_trump.11.d: "After establishing mining operations, SpaceX and NASA have both sent back their first shipments of space-material to labs and markets around the globe. The world has jelously looked on us, and there have been open talks in their respective chambers of legislation about opening their own asteroid mining operations. While we soon may get competition, we can enjoy the monopoly for now."
 donald_trump.11.o1: "Huzzah!"

 donald_trump.12.t: "Profits from Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.12.d: "The latest shipments from our asteroid mining operations have come in, and have generated many revenues. These shipments include platinum, gold, and silver. Putting the revenues to good use would be wise."
 donald_trump.12.o1: "Excellent!"

 donald_trump.13.t: "Potential for Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.d: "Recently, Donald Trump has allowed NASA and SpaceX, a private space company, to bring a fairly large asteroid into orbit of Earth and mine it. Our advisors recommend we invest in this new space, as it could allow rare materials to be delivered straight to our country. Some, however, have cited the massive bill the United States had to pay to even start the operations, and oppose expanding into space. The return for this investment depends, but it may take 25 years to just break even. More substantial investment can bring this down, but we'll be far behind the United States for quite a while.\n\nWhat shall we do in regards to Asteroid Mining? Start a national program, or ignore it altogether?"
 donald_trump.13.o1: "Invest in Asteroid Mining"
 donald_trump.13.o2: "Too expensive and a waste of our time!"

 #Mission To Mars Event Chain

 #Some events are out of order for the event number, but in order for the chain both in the code and order it appears
 donald_trump.23.t: "Mission to Mars"
 donald_trump.23.d: "Mr. President, with funding secured, and plans complete, we can now prepare a group of men and women to withstand the immense pressure and loneliness in space in order to reach Mars.\n\nLuckily, NASA has already been preparing for such a trip for years, it's just not had the funding to launch a full program. The additional training of current astronauts and preparation of the rocket will start in earnest.\n\nThis process will take roughly a year for it to complete. In the mean time, scientists at NASA laboratories are preparing scientific equipment to be sent along with the astronauts to Mars to collect useful scientific data that one cannot achieve with a rover. Do keep in mind, SpaceX may attempt to get a man there first upon hearing the announcement."
 donald_trump.23.o1: "Preparations shall begin"

 donald_trump.24.t: "Space Race"
 donald_trump.24.d: "In a recent news release, SpaceX has decided to launch its own program to get to Mars in under a year. Now, if SpaceX gets there first, it will still be an achievement that you can use for additional investment into space, however, it will be... let's just say... not as politically convinient.\n\nThis new Space Race for Mars will require additional investment if we are wanting to secure victory first, however, some experts argue that Elon Musk's program lacks certain aspects required to go to Mars with a crewed mission there and back. We may just be able to get to Mars first without assigning additional funds to NASA.\n\nWhat is your directive, Mr. President?"
 donald_trump.24.o1: "Space Race it is!"
 donald_trump.24.o2: "Continue at the current pace"

 donald_trump.14.t: "Mission to Mars Ready"
 donald_trump.14.d: "NASA has just sent confirmation that the astronauts, equipment, and rocket are ready. There are six particular astronauts heading to Mars with a return journey. The astronauts heading to Mars are as follows: Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne. These astronauts have prepared over the past two years, and are the most fit astronauts for this mission. The rocket, NASA's recent Space Launch System, is ready to be launched. The capsule, the Orion Space Capsule, is also ready.\n\nFortunately, the next launch window is in 30 days."
 donald_trump.14.o1: "30 days until launch!"

 donald_trump.15.t: "On the Launch Pad"
 donald_trump.15.d: "[GetDateText]:\nOur six astronauts are ready. It will be a long difficult journey, but they are prepared for it. Paul seems especially excited about the prospect, while the rest of the crew is nervous, particularly Rodney, albeit willing.\n\nThe Astronauts are in the rocket, ready to blast off into Space. They gave their farewells to family and friends, for they will not see them in person for nearly two years. All are optimistic for a successful mission.\n\nThe countdown has begun, with the launch confirmed."
 donald_trump.15.o1: "3, 2, 1..."

 donald_trump.16.t: "Lift Off!"
 donald_trump.16.d: "Launch Control has certified liftoff, and the rocket and crew are heading to Mars! People's heads are towards the sky, as the rocket heading for orbit. Its crew are both ecstatic and relieved, as it's a perfect launch. Everything has worked so far, and there is much hope that it will continue to work for months to come.\n\nThe dream is near complete."
 donald_trump.16.o1: "An exciting day in history"

 donald_trump.17.t: "Disaster Strikes!"
 donald_trump.17.d: "The rocket has exploded!\n\nIt turns out that the essential final checks were inadequate to stop a catastrophe. It has been reported that all six crew members, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne, have died in this calamity. The spectators on the ground are watching in disbelief as flames engulf the launch pad. It will much weaken the will for space in the coming future, and will be a stain on your presidency."
 donald_trump.17.o1: "A fatal accident"

 donald_trump.18.t: "Insanity in Space"
 donald_trump.18.d: "It turns out that prolonged periods in isolation with only five others to talk to are not suitable at all for the human psyche.\n\nDespite going through severe training before-hand, one astronaut, Michael, went mentally insane and attempted to manually control the craft to return to Earth as soon as possible. Anne, the only other person awake at the time, attempted to get in his way and halt him, however, she was unable to wrestle him away from the controls. While she was attempting to do this, Michael punched Anne in the jaw, knocking her unconcious.\n\nFortunately, the other crew members were wakened by the disorder, and immediately jumped to aid Anne. A quick struggle ensued where the control panel was slightly dented, however, everything remains operational and Michael is now in a makeshift prison with makeshift handcuffs. Additional good news, Anne was not permanently injured, and will be able to recover within a week on the vessel. Whether she has long term damage would have to be investigated by doctors at home.\n\nThe bad news is that the rocket is widely off-course. Additionally, a lot of fuel was burned in Michael's hasty attempt to return to Earth.\n\nThere are two options: Return to Earth with all the astronauts, arresting Michael for assualt and endangering five other lives, or send them on a one way trip to Mars. The five astronauts have expressed that they are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of humanity.\n\nMr. President. What is your choice?"
 donald_trump.18.o1: "If the remaining astronauts are ready for it, then let them go"
 donald_trump.18.o2: "Let's get our men and women home, and arrest that son of a bitch"

 donald_trump.19.t: "Shamed Return"
 donald_trump.19.d: "Months ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts onboard to return to Earth to avoid a one-way trip. Anne has been sent to the hospital to investigate if she has injuries undiscovered by the crew, and Michael has been arrested and will likely be sent to a mental hospital. The other astronauts, other than Mary, have offered their services again to space, while Mary has decided to retire from her astronaut career early. They are all happy to be home alive.\n\nThis is likely the end to any government program to send humans to Mars for quite a long time to come."
 donald_trump.19.o1: "Unfortunate, but at least they're alive"

 donald_trump.20.t: "Sacrifice on Mars"
 donald_trump.20.d: "Weeks ago, an altercation onboard the rocket to Mars forced the astronauts to make the difficult decision to commit to a one-way trip to Mars. They have landed and have explored the Martian surface. They only have so long to live, so they intend to make the most of it. Significant research opportunities will result from this, however, it comes at a cost of human life. Stranded, and without a permanent source of food, the crew will starve and die on Mars, leaving their bodies on the surface until, hopefully, one day, a team comes to Mars to retrieve them and give a proper burial on Earth. Until then, they will lie there for eternity."
 donald_trump.20.o1: "Martyrs on Mars"

 donald_trump.21.t: "The Eagle has Landed"
 donald_trump.21.d1: "The landing on Mars is a success! The crew onboard is joyous, and the viewers at home on Earth are as excited as ever for space travel. They will stay here for a few days, taking scientific samples and experiments, before heading back to Earth. The excitement for space will ensure that future missions into space will be politically easy to do, and will enhance the popularity of your presidency. However, the United States is now, once again, pushing the boundaries of space."
 donald_trump.21.d2: "The NASA landing on Mars, the second successful landing to be had on Mars, is a success! The crew onboard is joyous, and the viewers at home on Earth, with this and the SpaceX landing, are as excited as ever for space travel. They will stay here for a few days, taking scientific samples and experiments, before heading back to Earth. The excitement for space will ensure that future missions into space will be politically easy to do, and will enhance the popularity of your presidency. However, the United States, both public and private, is now, once again, pushing the boundaries of space."
 donald_trump.21.o1: "Hip Hip Hurray for the USA!"
 donald_trump.21.o2: "Second isn't so bad"

 donald_trump.22.t: "Heroic Return"
 donald_trump.22.d1: "Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne have made it home safely on a trip which will make the history books as one of the most important space flights ever to have been achieved. They bring back countless rocks and priceless data that will be processed in laboratories all around the globe. Hopefully, this will pave the way for the future colonization of Mars."
 donald_trump.22.d2: "Despite being second, Michael, Paul, Edward, Rodney, Mary, and Anne have made it home safely on a round trip to Mars. They bring back countless rocks and priceless data that will be processed in laboratories all around the globe. Hopefully, this, along with the SpaceX landing, will pave the way for the future colonization of Mars."
 donald_trump.22.o1: "Our heroes are home"
 donald_trump.22.o2: "They're home"

 donald_trump.25.t: "SpaceX Reaches Mars"
 donald_trump.25.d1: "Despite our best efforts, SpaceX has managed to land on Mars first, beating us in the space race. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars first, before NASA with it's huge financial advantage. We still celebrate this occasion, as it will bring many new discoveries to the sciences of space exploration and Mars."
 donald_trump.25.d2: "SpaceX is the second organization to land on Mars. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars, just after NASA with it's huge financial advantage. We still celebrate this occasion, since it will hopefully lead to successes in the future for SpaceX and Elon Musk."
 donald_trump.25.d3: "SpaceX is the second organization to land on Mars, albeit will likely be the first to do a successful round trip. They have landed their Starship on the Martian surface, near the site where we landed our doomed mission, and are taking the bodies home, much to the relief of their families at home. This task for a private company was a huge undertaking, and we applaud them just for getting to Mars. We still celebrate this occasion, since it will hopefully lead to successes in the future for SpaceX and Elon Musk."
 donald_trump.25.o1: "Regardless of who does it first, it's still an amazing accomplishment"
 donald_trump.25.o2: "It's still an amazing accomplishment"

 #Lunar Outpost Event Chain

 donald_trump.26.t: "Outpost on the Moon"
 donald_trump.26.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
 donald_trump.26.o1: "Launch!"

 donald_trump.27.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
 donald_trump.27.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 donald_trump.27.o1: "Science!"

 donald_trump.28.t: "Colony Progresses"
 donald_trump.28.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 donald_trump.28.o1: "We're good at being pioneers"

 donald_trump.29.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.29.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 donald_trump.29.o1: "Send emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.29.o2: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"

 donald_trump.30.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
 donald_trump.30.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surpise, and many at NASA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
 donald_trump.30.o1: "Life continues on"

 donald_trump.31.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 donald_trump.31.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurance, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the saftey of the modules. After the previous explosion, NASA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. NASA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so NASA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
 donald_trump.31.o1: "Send more emergency aid!"
 donald_trump.31.o2: "We can't continue doing things like this"

 donald_trump.32.t: "Moonbase Beta"
 donald_trump.32.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase.With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entreprenuers and corporations are flooding to NASA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your dilligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and American."

 donald_trump.500.t: "Dealing with ISIS"
 donald_trump.500.d: "For years, ISIS has been a terrorist threat not seen ever in history. Their influence is all over the globe, and while their in Iraq and Syria shrinks, their strangleholds in other areas continues. A determined bombing campaign would put an end to the terrorist threat. It would certainly be costly; however, it would lead to the eventual demise of ISIS. Another approach is to simply continue operations normally, still pounding ISIS troops, but with far less costs than the former option. A last option is to fully withdraw from the campaign against ISIS as it has almost been won already. While this would strengthen ISIS, it would allow us to divert resources to other areas. Mr. President, what shall we do?"

With ISIS a threat on our border, we may fully consider a subsidy to the United States of America for this action. Subsidizing this move will perhaps get us in a better standing with the United States, however, it will take money out of our own pockets."

 donald_trump_news.0.t: "US Suspends War Against ISIS"
 donald_trump_news.0.d: "In a surprising White House press release, the Trump Administration has announced the withdrawal of US forces from the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump tweeted upon the matter, calling ISIS a \"dead terrorist group\" and that \"US troops will focus on other things.\" Supporters call this move necessary to limit unnecessary expenditure, while the opposition state that this will only make the terrorism situation worse. Experts believe this will embolden ISIS into taking an offensive stance against her neighbors, as she gathers more fighters in Iraq and Sytria. The Administration has made no comment to this critique so far."

In a press conference earlier today, WNN correspondant, Michael Miller, asked the President \"What are the current plans for American intevention against ISIS.\" Donald Trump replied to the statement by saying \"US bomber crews, of whom are very, very tough people, believe me. I mean, have you seen those people? They will fly over into Syria, and bomb the hell outta ISIS. Trust me, you will never have seen anything like it ever before.\" Experts warn this plan is expensive, but the President is adamant about his plans for ISIS. Additional details will be released soon about the matter."

 donald_trump_news.2.d: "Earlier today the President of the United States announced the Asteroid Mining Initiative. This organization \"will seek to find an asteroid, bring it into the orbit of Earth, mine it, and send its resources back to the USA.\" Many doubt if this could ever be profitable, as the immense costs will consume much of NASA's budget, however, the President has voiced his wishes for private space companies to do some of the work. One particular favorite, SpaceX, was pointed out directly in his speech on the AMI, stating \"Smart people, and boy, do we have some smart people, like my good friend at SpaceX, Elon Musk, will be able to send their space mining equipment to the asteroid, mine it, and sell it for profit. It will be a tremendous business, believe me.\" There are serious concerns for asteroid mining, however the Administration has been dismissive of those concerns, instead focusing on the rewards of the project. Whether this is successful or not will time will tell."

 donald_trump_news.3.d: "A large celebration was held in Florida today as shipments of platinum, gold, and silver reached the ground from space in a spectacular display. These materials of materials are not from any normal mine, but from asteroids.  A few months ago, NASA caught a large asteroid heading on a course which would place itself nearby earth. A relatively slow asteroid, it was pulled into an elliptical orbit with Earth. Mining operations started as soon as it was in orbit. This news has been a surpise to the world, as it has been done far faster than expected. Many countries are now seeking to start their own asteroid mining programs to counteract the American monopoly. The United States does claim the entire asteroid. However, this claim can only be sparsely enforced as the asteroid is so large. Asteroid mining will likely become a lucrative industry, with many successes and failures. Who will dominate the asteroid, nonetheless, remains a mystery."

Elon Musk, today, has announced that he will also be getting to Mars, before NASA. This new \"Space race\" between the public NASA and private SpaceX, both American organizations, have people wondering: Who will prevail?\n\nElon Musk intends to use his new Starship and Super-Heavy booster to get people to Mars. This new rocket is huge, but not as big as NASA's Space Launch System.

More enthusiasm surrounds SpaceX than ever before, as Elon Musk's personal popularity skyrockets. This success has impacted Elon Musk's other company too, Tesla, which saw a minor sales and stock boost.\n\nDonald Trump has commented on the matter, congratulating Elon Musk and SpaceX for their accomplishment, adding that \"This shows that private companies can do better than the government!\" Donald Trump's initiative for space may have played a part in getting to Mars so early, however, many say that SpaceX, Blue Origin, and NASA have all had ambitions for Mars.

Elon said upon the matter on Twitter that, \"Moonbase Beta will provide so many new opportunities not only for SpaceX, but for humanity as a whole.\" A poll conducted today after the announcement found that 74% of people are excited for space exploration and colonization.
