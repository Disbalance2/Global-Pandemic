 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces: "The ROK Armed Forces"
 KOR_the_rok_armed_forces_desc: "The Republic of Korea's existence is defined by its constant vulnerability. Clashes with the North are constant reminders of the threat that the DPRK poses to our citizens' security. Beyond the peninsula, we must remain vigilant against new and old enemies that would wish to do us harm. To guard against all such threats, our armed forces must be as strong as they possibly can be."
 KOR_foreign_procurement: "Foreign Procurement"
 KOR_foreign_procurement_desc: "While over the years we have developed a robust domestic arms industry, there are gaps in our indigenous capabilities that are better filled by equipment imported from abroad."
 KOR_p8_poseidon: "The P-8 Poseidon"
 KOR_p8_poseidon_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired. These maritime patrol aircraft have only detected 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises, and therefore need to be replaced with newer models. The Boeing P-8 Poseidon was developed by the US to replace its own P-3Cs. It may be wise for us to follow the example of our strongest ally."
 KOR_c295: "The C-295"
 KOR_c295_desc: "It is time for our aging fleet of P-3Cs to be retired. These maritime patrol aircraft have only detected 28% of North Korean submarines involved in exercises, and therefore need to be replaced with newer models. The Spanish C-296 MPA is a significantly more affordable option than the P-8, but is generally considered an inferior aircraft."
 KOR_upgrade_f16s: "Upgrade F-16s"
 KOR_upgrade_f16s_desc: "Contracting Lockheed Martin to bring our F-16s up to the F-16V standard is an important stop-gap measure to maintain the effectiveness of our air force before we make the transition towards a a fifth generation fighter."
 KOR_order_f35s: "Order F-35s"
 KOR_order_f35s_desc: "It will be impossible for the Republic of Korea Air Force to match its more advanced rivals in the region without acquiring a fifth generation aircraft.

 KOR_kss_program: "KSS Program"
 KOR_kss_program_desc: "The Korean Attack Submarine program is an important project that seeks up to build up the ROK Navy's domestic attack submarine capability. Now that our domestic manufacturers have learned from the technical know-how of German and Swedish submarine manufacturers, the time for an indigenous Korean submarine is upon us."
 KOR_ffx_program: "FFX Program"
 KOR_ffx_program_desc: "Guided missile frigates are a key part of the Republic of Korea's coastal defense. Regular clashes with the North Korean navy have proven the worth of these ships. As such we should invest time and money into the fleet of frigates that has defended our shores from hostile forces."
 KOR_kdx_program: "KDX Program"
 KOR_kdx_program_desc: "Our experimental destroyer program is a key part of our naval modernization effort. Not only do destroyers help the ROK Navy defend our country's immediate maritime periphery, but they also help extend the reach of our naval forces, in doing so helping us reach our goal of a blue-water navy."
 KOR_lpx_program: "LPX Program"
 KOR_lpx_program_desc: "Our amphibious landing ships are the pride and joy of our planned rapid response fleets, furthering the dream of an ROK Navy that has the ability to strike quickly and decisively across long distances. It is only by achieving a blue-water navy that we can guarantee the security of our territory, including the Dokdo islands after which the first of our LPX vessels is named."
 KOR_jeju_complex: "The Jeju Complex"
 KOR_jeju_complex_desc: "Jeju island's strategic position on the southern-most tip of the peninsula makes it the ideal location for an expanded naval base that can host our strategic mobile fleet. From Jeju the pride of our navy will be able to protect the maritime sea lanes of communication that cross the East China Sea."

 KOR_modernize_the_army: "Modernize the Army"
 KOR_modernize_the_army_desc: "The state of army is far from ideal. Despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, the equipment of the average Korean infantrymen is embarassingly old-fashioned. The demographic pressures of our low birth-rate must mean that we cannot rely on troop numbers alone to guarantee the ROK's security. Quality must be favored over quantity."
 KOR_rd_funding: "R&D Funding"
 KOR_rd_funding_desc: "In order to improve our military capabilities we must make use of one of the ROK's strongest assets, our advanced industrial capacity. To do this we must invest in the development of new military technologies."

 KOR_women_in_the_special_forces: "Women in the Special Forces"
 KOR_women_in_the_special_forces_desc: "As it stands not all of the positions in our armed forces are open to all. This cannot continue given our growing manpower deficit, and a growing need to acknowledge the fact that women have the ability to perform just as well as men. Any brave female volunteer should be able to join the special forces, so long as they meet the high standards of those units."
 KOR_ticn_program: "TICN Program"
 KOR_ticn_program_desc: "The Tactical Information Communication Network program will update our current outdated, inefficient voice-operated modes of communication.

 KOR_bolster_cyber_security: "Bolster Cyber Security"
 KOR_bolster_cyber_security_desc: "Our increasing reliance on digital systems such as TICN program, while strengthening our armed forces, also makes us vulnerable to cyber threats. We must increase our cyber security capabilities in order to guard against this growing danger."

 KOR_warrior_platform: "Warrior Platform"
 KOR_warrior_platform_desc: "The equipment of the average Korean infantrymen unfortunately does not meet global standards, and Korean War-era equipment still remains in use.

 KOR_new_uniforms: "New Uniforms"
 KOR_new_uniforms_desc: "A warming climate and increasingly urbanized environment means that our existing uniforms are in need of replacement. A new camouflage pattern will help ensure that our troops are well-suited to the battlefields of tomorrow."
 KOR_focus_on_the_sof: "Focus on the SOF"
 KOR_focus_on_the_sof_desc: "The ROK's special forces have played an essential role in performing operations that require the skill and precision that ordinary troops cannot match. A concentrated effort to improve the training and equipment of these forces will help make the units under the ROK Army's Special Warfare Command some of the most effective in the world."
 KOR_slimmer_but_smarter: "Slimmer but Smarter"
 KOR_slimmer_but_smarter_desc: "Through the Warrior Platform program, the ROK Army has succeeded in providing each individual Korean soldier with cutting edge technology, allowing even a single infantryman to function as an effective fighting force. This means that even with reduced troop numbers, our military will be able to respond decisively to any hostile force."
 KOR_korea_aerospace_industries: "Korea Aerospace Industries"
 KOR_korea_aerospace_industries_desc: "KAI is our foremost aerospace and defense company. Established as a merger of Samsung Aerospace, Daewoo Heavy Industries' aerospace division and the Hyundai Space and Aircraft Company, KAI combines the technological know-how of Korea's most prominent defense contractors. Without KAI's assistance it will be impossible to develop indigenous aircraft."
 KOR_korean_helicopters: "Korean Helicopters"

 KOR_next_generation_uavs: "Next-Generation UAVs"

 KOR_korean_space_program: "Korean Space Program"
 KOR_korean_space_program_desc: "A viable space program has become the mark of an advanced, powerful nation. Developing our own capability to send astronauts into space will prove to the world and to our own citizens just how far our country has come since its humble beginnings."
 KOR_conscription_policy: "Conscription Policy"
 KOR_conscription_policy_desc: "The issues that our army suffer from are not limited to outdated equipment alone. Korea's low birth-rate and its associated demographic cliff means that our already worrying small manpower pool continues to shrink. Moreover, many of our conscripts suffer from poor morale due to their resentment of the coerciveness of national service, while others refuse to serve altogether."
 KOR_tolerate_objectors: "Legalize Conscientious Objectors"
 KOR_tolerate_objectors_desc: "The criticism we have received for our harsh treatment of conscientious objectors is well-founded. A country that has come to value human rights as much as we do cannot be seen to be coercing its own citizens to serve in the army. We should therefore allow conscientious objectors to serve their country through other, less objectionable means."
 KOR_maintain_hardline_approach: "Maintain Hardline Approach"
 KOR_maintain_hardline_approach_desc: "Our country has not survived for this long without the discipline and resilience that comes with compulsory national service. Allowing conscientious objectors to go unpunished will ultimately make our country more vulnerable to the ever-present northern threat."
 KOR_reduce_conscription: "Reduce Conscription"
 KOR_reduce_conscription_desc: "The size of our military will never be able to match that of our northern counterpart. We must instead focus on maintaining a leaner, but more committed army and play to our strengths."
 KOR_require_naturalized_citizens: "Require Naturalized Citizens to Serve"
 KOR_require_naturalized_citizens_desc: "Our manpower shortage can be addressed by requiring naturalized citizens as well as those born in the ROK to serve in the armed forces. While this will help counteract a reduction in draftees due to Korea's shrinking population, it will discourage foreigners from acquiring Korean citizenship."
 KOR_repeal_article_92_6: "Repeal Artice 92-6"
 KOR_repeal_article_92_6_desc: "Our criminalization of same-sex relations in the military through Article 92-6 has led to criticism from human rights organizations and pro-LGBTQ+ activists. Repealing this law would end this unwelcome attention and reduce the number of conscientious objectors."

 KOR_state_of_the_republic: "The State of the Republic"
 KOR_state_of_the_republic_desc: "Founded in August 1948, the modern day Republic of Korea inherits a long and painful historical legacy.

 KOR_the_korean_left: "The Korean Left"
 KOR_the_korean_left_desc: "The Korean Left's political vision is one that privileges the interests of ordinary people over the elite chaebols and reconciliation with the North over confrontation. It is a vision that is decidedly anti-status quo, seeking a transformation of South Korea's economic system and its international position. The modern Korean Left inherits the mantle of the pro-democracy movement that toppled Korea's autocracy."
 KOR_anti_capitalist_backlash: "Anti-Capitalist Backlash"

 KOR_support_underground_organizations: "Support Underground Organizations"

 KOR_national_liberation: "National Liberation"
 KOR_national_liberation_desc: "The workers of the Korean peninsula will never truly be free until the peninsula is reunited under a North Korean-style government. The process of our nation's liberation must be articulated within an anti-imperialist discourse that the North has consistently promoted."
 KOR_form_armed_militias: "Form Armed Militias"
 KOR_form_armed_militias_desc: "In order to prepare for the upcoming conflict we must secrely begin mobilising a volunteer corps of loyal fighters willing to take up arms to restore the Korean nation."
 KOR_make_preparations: "Make Preparations"
 KOR_make_preparations_desc: "A revolution will not be possible without the necessary resources. Above all, what we need are weapons. Vulnerable police armories and the Chinese black market serve as useful sources of such materiel."

 KOR_request_northern_assistance: "Request Northern Assistance"

 KOR_address_inequality: "Economic Democratization"
 KOR_address_inequality_desc: "While Korea has achieved remarkable economic development, it remains a deeply unequal society. The gulf between average working Koreans and the ultra-rich chaebols must be addressed. In pursuit of a fairer economy, we should begin supporting low-income workers, corner-shop retailers, and SMEs so that its not just large conglomerates who benefit from economic growth."
 KOR_income_led_growth: "Income-Led Growth"
 KOR_income_led_growth_desc: "To stimulate growth while reducing our dependence on chaebols, we must boost the spending power of Korean consumers by increasing social spending and wages. However, this policy will be opposed by large employers."

 KOR_clamp_down_on_anti_competitive_practices_desc: "The domination of the chaebols is harming competition. In this environment, it is difficult for SMEs and startups to survive. Attacking the anti-competitive practices of chaebols will go a long way towards addressing this issue."

 KOR_ratify_ilo_conventions: "Ratify ILO Conventions"

 KOR_joint_development: "Kaesong Industrial Park"
 KOR_joint_development_desc: "The Kaesong industrial park is an important symbol of inter-Korean cooperation and the future prospect of reunification.

However, some are concerned that the complex could benefit the North's weapons programs."
 KOR_sporting_events: "Cultural Exchanges"
 KOR_sporting_events_desc: "By fielding joint sporting teams to international events and featuring North Korean cinema in the South, we can improve the people-to-people exchanges between North and South.

 KOR_restrict_cyber_operations: "Restrict Domestic Operations"

 KOR_protect_whistle_blowers: "Protect Whistle-Blowers"
 KOR_protect_whistle_blowers_desc: "While it is not viable to make the NIS completely transparent given the importance of maintaining secrecy, there are other ways to ensure accountability. One way is to institute greater protections for whistle-blowers within the organization who are brave enough to report the illegal or unconstitutional activity of their colleagues."
 KOR_strengthen_oversight: "Strengthen Oversight"
 KOR_strengthen_oversight_desc: "Greater legislative and judicial oversight is needed to limit the NIS's politicization. No longer can we afford to have a rogue intelligence agency that shapes Korea's politics for its own benefit."

 KOR_electoral_reform: "Electoral Reform"
 KOR_electoral_reform_desc: "Korea's contemporary politics are dominated by the two largest conservative and liberal parties.

 KOR_expand_proportional_representation: "Expand Proportional Representation"
 KOR_expand_proportional_representation_desc: "The expansion of proportional representation in the National Assembly will increase the importance of previously minor parties, bringing hope for a revitalization of Korean politics with new, dynamic thinking.

 KOR_end_proportional_representation: "End Proportional Representation"
 KOR_end_proportional_representation_desc: "Doing away with proportional representation will make it easier for one of the two major Korean parties to secure a majority in the National Assembly.

 KOR_progressive_policies: "Progressive Policies"
 KOR_progressive_policies_desc: "While the Korean left has had a strong influence in post-authoritarian Korea, socially progressive politics have been largely absent from the agenda of Korea's main left-wing political party.

 korea.8.t: "Radical Korean Movement Gains Popularity"
 korea.8.d: "Economic inequality in the Republic of Korea has contributed to growing dissatisfaction among the country's lower classes. Thousands of online activists have begun calling for the greater equality through the establishment of community-level autonomy throughout the ROK. While the movement is leaderless and therefore lacks a central, clear message, the majority of its members seem to desire an abolition of the Korean state and the chaebols that it is tied to in favor of a system that distributes political and economic power among directly elected community-level representatives.\n\nThis new ideology, which rejects the foundational ideologies of both the ROK and the DPRK, represents a significant departure from the traditional politics of the South Korean radical left, which has either promoted leftist policies within South Korea's existing political system or called for the establishment of a North Korean-style state."

 korea.10.d: "For quite some time now South Korea has endeavored to show that it no longer a country beholden to US interests. Relations between our two countries are at an all-time high, while our relations with the North have stagnated for the most part. Now a South Korean delegation has come to request an end to the defense treaty between us and the North Koreans.

 korea.13.d: "In a rare move the governments of China and the Republic of Korea have issued a joint statement criticizing Japan's wartime actions and its subsequent refusal to fully atone for them. Many observers have interpreted this move as part of Seoul's efforts to woo China away from its support for North Korea. While Pyongyang has expressed support for the joint condemnation by [KOR.GetLeader] and [CHI.GetLeader], [NKO.GetLeader] is reportedly concerned about signs that China is increasingly favouring Seoul."

 korea.15.d: "Following weeks of antagonistic rhetoric from Seoul and pressure by Korean activists, [KOR.GetLeader] has called upon Japan to pay reparations to survivors of Japanese war crimes committed during the Second World War. Japan, which maintains that the matter was settled between its government and that of South Korea during the rule of authoritarian strongman Park Chung-hee, has predictably refused to consider paying reparations.\n\nWhile the affair has failed to result in compensation for Korean victims, it has led to a strengthening of [KOR.GetLeader]'s political position with many Koreans rallying around this exceedingly emotive national cause."

 korea.21.d_no: "Unfortunately, neither of the two main parties was able to gain a majority in the National Assembly. Our government will have to fight harder to win over legislators from other parties in order to pass controversial legislation."
 korea.21.d_con_loss: "Unfortunately, our party has failed to secure a majority in the National Assembly. Liberal lawmakers will refuse to pass any legislation that constrains trade unions, supports big business, or promotes antagonism to North Korea."
 korea.21.d_lib_loss: "Unfortunately, our party has failed to secure a majority in the National Assembly. Conservative lawmakers will refuse to pass any legislation that constrains big business, reforms conscription and intelligence, or promotes reconciliation with North Korea."
 korea.21.d_con_win: "Fortunately, our party has succeeded in winning a majority in the National Assembly. The legislature and executive will be able to work hand in hand in order to facilitate conservative goals such as limiting trade unions, supporting the chaebols, and staying tough on North Korea."
 korea.21.d_lib_win: "Fortunately, our party has succeeded in winning a majority in the National Assembly. The legislature and executive will be able to work hand in hand in order to facilitate liberal goals such as weakening the chaebols, reforming the security apparatus, and pursuing reunification with the North."
 korea.22.t: "Reunification Shocks Begin to Take Hold"
 korea.22.d: "The great nation of Korea has finally been reunited, after many decades of painful separation. However, our task of reintegrating the two halves is far from over. Many on both sides of the 38th parallel are dissatisfied with the way in which reunification took place, and the economic costs of reunifiting two vastly different states are quickly becoming apparent. Should we fail in our task of reunifying the country, we may face the dissolution of our new-born nation."
 korea.22.a: "Now begins the hard part..."
 korea.23.t: "Our Response to the South's Peace Offer"
 korea.23.d: "After weeks of discussions, the time has come for us to decide whether we are willing to accept the South's offer of peace. We must consider whether we trust the sincerity of the South's offer, but also how agreeing a peace treaty will be perceived by our domestic supporters who still hope to reunify the country by force some day."
 korea.23.a: "We will agree to a treaty."
 korea.23.b: "There will never be peace between us!"
 korea.24.t: "Korean Peace Agreement Signed"
 korea.24.d: "Following an improvement in relations between the two Koreas, [KOR.GetLeader] of the South and [NKO.GetLeader] of the North have agreed to replace the tenuous Armistice Agreement with a formal peace settlement. This treaty has finally put an end to the state of hostilities that has existed between the two Koreas since the Korean War. Both leaders have expressed hopes that this development will set the peninsula on a path towards reunification, although some observers have expressed doubts about the willingness to pursue reunification on both sides."
 korea.24.a: "A bright future lies before the peninsula!"
 korea.25.t: "Inter-Korean Discussions Break Down"
 korea.25.d: "Talks at Panmunjom between [KOR.GetLeader] of the South and [NKO.GetLeader] of the North have broken down over various disagreements between the two sides. While the fact that there were some points of agreement has led some to hope for a return to talks in the future, it is clear that an agreement between the two Koreas will not be forthcoming for quite some time."
 korea.25.a: "Peace remains elusive..."
 korea.26.t: "South Korea proposes reunification"
 korea.26.d: "Seeking to capitalize on an unprecedented improvement in relations between the two Koreas, the South is offering to cooperate with us in order to reunify our divided nation. However, they are insisting that the process of reunification will be South-led, a demand that threatens the unique political culture that we have developed in the North."
 korea.26.d1: "Seeking to capitalize on an unprecedented improvement in relations between the two Koreas, the South is offering to cooperate with us in order to reunify our divided nation. The South, understanding our concerns about reunification, has offered to share power post-reunification through a unity government, incorporating elements of the North as well as the South."
 korea.26.a: "Our country will be whole again!"
 korea.26.b: "Reunification can never take place on these terms..."
 korea.27.t: "The North has agreed on our terms for reunification!"
 korea.27.d: "Following extensive negotiations, the North has agreed to begin working towards reunifying our two countries! With relations between the two Koreas stabilized and the reintegration of the peninsula on the horizon, the future of the Korean people has never looked brighter!"
 korea.27.a: "Fantastic news!"
 korea.28.t: "The North has refused our terms for reunification!"
 korea.28.d: "Regrettably, [NKO.GetLeader] has chosen to put their own selfish position before that of the Korean people and rejected our offer to cooperate on reunifying the country. This rejection does not mean that we cannot make another attempt at the future, but it does mean that reunification will not occur in the near future. We must lay the groundwork to ensure that our next attempt will meet with greater success."
 korea.28.a: "A sad day for the Korean people..."
