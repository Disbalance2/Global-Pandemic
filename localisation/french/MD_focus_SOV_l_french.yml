 SOV_resist_western_sanctions_desc: "The threat of economic sanctions has been applied against Russia even during Soviet times, and the experiences have only made the Russian economy more prepared to exist in states of autarchy and self-reliance.

 SOV_fight_international_capitalists: "Fight International Capitalists"
 SOV_fight_international_capitalists_desc: "The oligarchs are a dangerous and corrupt class, no better than the kulaks of Soviet times. Since the dissolution of the USSR, the Russian oligarchs have gobbled up more and more economic influence and driven Russian workers out of jobs, in favor of a globalistic economic model powered by foreign companies. To revive Russia, it is first essential to drive out the international capitalist class."
 SOV_weaken_the_banks: "Weaken the Banks"
 SOV_weaken_the_banks_desc: "Banks are the praetorian guard of capitalism, carrying its banner into combat and defending its profits with their very existence. They meddle in poor areas of the world, abuse the working class with wage dumping and interest speculations, and they influence politics with both legal and illegal donations.

 SOV_condemn_globalism: "Condemn Globalism"
 SOV_condemn_globalism_desc: "Globalism refers to the movement towards greater global political and economic cooperation. Of course, that's all capitalist horseshit. Globalism in reality is just a ploy to economically exploit the people and resources of our mighty Russia and to keep us as second-class citizens of the world.

 SOV_russian_sfsr: "The SFSR"
 SOV_russian_sfsr_desc: "We should not make the same mistake that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union's communism. The equality of nations under the USSR was a critical mistake, and we must instead engage in a nationally founded communism that is exclusively focussed on the needs, desires and sentiments of the Russians as a people and Russia as a nation. As a result, our communist state will be stronger and less likely to collapse to minorities."

 SOV_civilian_industrial_councils: "Civilian Industrial Councils"
 SOV_civilian_industrial_councils_desc: "In our efforts to rekindle Russian industrialism, we must create jobs that focus on carrying the Russian economy through the construction of a large amount of heavy machinery.

 SOV_strongarm_central_asia_desc: "The republics of Asia were never particularly central - except geographically - to Soviet life, but they were a vital and valued part of the communist experience nonetheless.

 russia.1.d: "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometers north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."

 #Russian News Events
 russia_news.1.t: "Vladimir Putin elected President"
 russia_news.1.d: "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his skeptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1: "Let's see how he does."
 russia_news.2.t: "Vladimir Zhirinovsky elected President"
 russia_news.2.d: "Even though most observers expected Boris Yeltsin's heir Vladimir Putin to win, it seems as if the Russian population has chosen the hyper-nationalistic Liberal Democratic Party and their leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to fill the position of Russian President."
 russia_news.2.o1: "Putin's career is at an end."
 russia_news.3.t: "Gennady Zyuganov elected President"
 russia_news.3.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1: "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t: "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d: "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described in a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favored among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."
 russia_news.4.o1: "Good luck, Grigory!"
 russia_news.4.o2: "...who?"
 russia_news.5.t: "Rise of the Soviet Union"

The collapse of the USSR, the dissolution of the Supreme Council, the Chechen campaigns, loans-for-shares auctions, the denomination and default of 1998 - all this fell on the shoulders of the Russian people and crushed the hopes for a brighter future. Russia has recently chosen a president with whom it will enter the third millennium. After the difficult 1990s, there was a demand in the country for a solid and effective leader. There were hopes that after the reforms, an improvement in life would finally come. That elementary order will be put in place. And it was on Putin, who rapidly gained popularity as prime minister and acting. President, these hopes were pinned. In the 90s, after the shooting of the White House, as well as numerous disagreements in Russian society, a politician came to power who was able to consolidate all the warring parties and began to create a new political system ... What will come of it?"

At the same time, it became known about the demonstrators' attempt to break through the dense police cordon. According to Vedomosti correspondents, it was then that a Molotov cocktail flew to the police. In response, the police began to detain oppositionists breaking through the cordon and put them on buses. According to the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, despite the fact that the protesters threw dangerous objects at the police, the gas was not used against them. A law enforcement source told Vedomosti that Article 212 on inciting to riots is being tried on the organizers of the event, including Sergei Udaltsov and Alexei Navalny. So far, they are not suspects yet.

The personnel of the police and the SBU waited, there was no mass support of the locals. Quite a lot of people were really going to watch regular rallies, but there were very few people in the seized premises of the regional administration in Donetsk: they were city madmen, criminal and semi-criminal persons, pro-Russian activists, visiting Russian outcasts from the border regions. Of the entire cohort of leaders of the then DPR, only Alexander Khryakov and Andrey Purgin from the public organization Donetsk Republic, founded back in the mid-2000s, were relatively well-known. Almost everyone in Donetsk was firmly convinced that the home-grown separatists would rally for several days and disperse. However, the situation escalated sharply. Moreover, where they were not expected - in Slavyansk (population - 120 thousand at that time) in the north of the region, a detachment of armed people of 52 people entered. First of all, they seized the city police department almost without resistance.

 Sov_warsaw_pact.4.d: "With the recent restoration of the Warsaw Pact, many politicians and experts have been asking the question - when will the new enlargement take place? Today, the Warsaw Pact is celebrating a new expansion of its alliance. A new Cold War has begun, and U.S. influence is slowly crumbling in eastern Europe."

 Sov_warsaw_pact.5.t: "A new ally and new opportunities"

 Sov_warsaw_pact.6.a: "Let's sign a new Treaty!"

 sov_warsaw_pact.9.t: "Communist uprising in East Germany"
 sov_warsaw_pact.9.d: "The situation is out of control. Our efforts to ensure stability in the country were in vain, as an uprising was launched in East Germany to create an independent GDR. With the help of the military, as well as secret financial and arms assistance from the USSR, all administrative and military buildings in the east of the country were seized. Berlin was cut off from the rest of the country. Because of the risk of being involved in a conflict with the Soviets, we are forced to conduct localized attacks on the territory of the newly formed GDR. But we can also launch a direct intervention into the zone of interest of the USSR. However, this could lead to World War III. What should we do?"
 sov_warsaw_pact.9.a: "We'll squash them like bedbugs!"

 german_proxy_war.2.a: "And yet our army should be reformed."
 #Warsaw Pact Decisions Influence
 SOV_restoration_of_influence_category: "Waning influence in Eastern Europe"
 SOV_restoration_of_influence_category_desc: "The Cold War, which lasted 40 years, has just recently ended. Russia began to rapidly lose its influence in Europe and the rest of the world due to internal strife and betrayal. Its troops were withdrawn from eastern Europe, and the country itself broke up into 15 independent republics. Despite the internal problems, Russia has successfully coped with them, and has recently begun to restore its prestige on the world stage. NATO's infrastructure has gotten very close to Russia's backyard in the meantime, and it needs to stop that. If Russia does not take action to strengthen its influence in Europe, Russia will be in mortal danger."
