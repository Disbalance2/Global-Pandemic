 centralkaz.1.t: "Our Kazakhstan"
 centralkaz.1.d: "Kazakhstan is an amazing country rich in history and nature. Its history goes back thousands of years, starting from ancient times, when nomadic peoples such as the Scythians and the Sakis inhabited this land. An important part of Kazakhstan's history was the formation of the Great Steppe, where unique cultures and ways of life were formed.\n\nOne of the important stages of Kazakhstan's history was the formation of khanates such as the Kazakh Khanate and the Zhungar Khanate. These periods were characterized by the development of trade, culture and art.\n\nIn the 19th century, Kazakhstan became an object of interest to world powers and was eventually incorporated into the Russian Empire. This period brought with it significant changes in Kazakhstan's society and economy.\n\nKazakhstan has a unique natural wealth, including vast steppes, majestic mountains and numerous lakes and rivers. This nature is now becoming increasingly important for maintaining the ecological balance in the region."
 centralkaz.1.a: "Interesting"

Uzbekistan's first president, Islam Karimov, led the country for many years and introduced reforms in the economy, education and health care. Uzbekistan became one of the largest cotton producers in the world and actively developed its export industries.\n\n\nThe period of Uzbekistan's independence faced challenges such as fighting extremism and terrorism, but the country worked hard to strengthen its security and stability.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Uzbekistan's history at the time of independence is not limited to economic and political aspects. The country is rich in cultural heritage, and its people are proud of their traditions and history. National holidays and festivals reflect the richness of Uzbek culture and traditions."
 centraluzb.1.a: "Interesting"

 centralkyr.1.d: "Kyrgyzstan gained its independence in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. This historic moment was a landmark for the people of Kyrgyzstan, who were now able to shape their own destiny.

The country has formed a stable society and has an active role in the international arena. Kyrgyzstan is famous for its cultural riches, including traditional songs and dances, and beautiful nature, including the Tien Shan Mountains."
 centralkyr.1.a: "Interesting"

It also actively cooperates with other countries on security issues and conducts joint exercises."

Economic, educational and cultural development have become important priorities for our nation. Kazakhstan has become more open to the global community, strengthened its relations with other countries and actively participated in addressing global issues.\n\nThis anniversary is also an opportunity to look to the future with hope and optimism.

 centralkaz.3.a: "Interesting"
 centralkaz.4.t: "Nursultan Nazarbayev resigned"
 centralkaz.4.d: "After 30 years in power, the first President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, decided to resign. This decision caused a wave of surprise and discussion both inside and outside the country.\n\nNursultan Nazarbayev had made a huge contribution to the development of Kazakhstan, which had evolved from a Soviet republic into an independent state with a strong economy and geopolitical role. His resignation marked the end of an era, but also signaled Kazakhstan's aspirations for further development and democratization.\n\nThe new President of Kazakhstan was Kasym-Jomart Tokayev, who was elected by the parliament. This transition of power was conducted in accordance with the country's constitution, which emphasizes the importance of adhering to legal procedures and institutions in building a democratic society.\n\nThese events have undoubtedly influenced the political picture not only in Kazakhstan, but also in the region as a whole. They call for a discussion on the future of Kazakhstan and the role of this country on the world stage. The decision of Nursultan Nazarbayev and the arrival of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev may be the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Kazakhstan."
 centralkaz.4.a: "Interesting"
 centralkaz.5.t: "Amendments to the constitution"
 centralkaz.5.d: "The referendum approved constitutional amendments that significantly changed the country's form of government. These changes meant a transition from a super-presidential form of government to a presidential republic with a powerful parliament and an accountable government.\n\nOne of the key points of these amendments was the removal from the constitution of all references to the status of Nursultan Nazarbayev as the first President of Kazakhstan. This symbolized the transition to a new era in the country's political history based on democratic principles and separation of powers.\n\nThe changes to the constitution also strengthened the role of parliament and emphasized the importance of state institutions in decision-making. Kazakhstan, following this path, is striving to become a more democratic and open society.\n\nNursultan Nazarbayev's departure from the status of the first President means the end of one chapter in Kazakhstan's history, but the beginning of a new one, where the role of civil society and political institutions becomes more significant. These changes signal a search for a balanced approach to governance and democratic participation of citizens in the future development of the country."
 centralkaz.5.a: "Interesting"
 centralkaz.6.t: "The beginning of the protests"
 centralkaz.6.d: "The events that unfolded in Kazakhstan today have left many citizens in a state of shock and anxiety. The onset of protests in the country has caused concern on both a national and global scale. Peaceful expression of civic position is important for any country, but in this case, it seems that the problems have reached a critical point.\n\nThe past events that led to the start of the protests have brought to the forefront issues of social injustice, corruption and political reform. The citizens of Kazakhstan have expressed their discontent and are demanding change. However, it is important to remember that the protests come at a difficult time for the country, and despite the divisions, it is important to maintain peace and stability.\n\nPerhaps now Kazakhstan should seek assistance from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) to prevent escalation of the conflict and find ways to dialogue and conflict resolution. Cooperation and support from international organizations can play an important role in restoring stability and putting the country on a path of reform and development."
 centralkaz.6.a: "Violently suppress protests"

 centralkaz.7.t: "Protests continue, Kazakhstan requests assistance from CSTO"
 centralkaz.7.d: "The continuation of protests in Kazakhstan and the country's request for assistance from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is a development that requires serious attention and analysis. Despite attempts by the authorities to resolve the conflict, the protests continue, and this indicates serious problems within the country.\n\nSuch situations emphasize the importance of international cooperation and support in critical moments. The CSTO, as an international organization specializing in ensuring security and stability in the region, can play an important role in resolving the conflict and providing the necessary assistance to Kazakhstan."
 centralkaz.7.a: "Request CSTO assistance"
 centralkaz.7.b: "Hold elections"
 centralkaz.8.t: "Kazakhstan requests assistance"
 centralkaz.8.d: "Kazakhstan's request for assistance from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is an event that requires serious discussion and analysis on the part of the international community. Our response to this request should be considered and balanced.\n\nFirst of all, the CSTO, as an international organization, should take into account the principles of respect for the sovereignty and independence of States. Our response should emphasize the importance of supporting Kazakhstan in achieving stability and peace in the region.\n\nHowever, it must ensure that CSTO assistance does not exacerbate the conflict or lead to human rights violations. Our response should include mechanisms for monitoring and resolving the situation, as well as facilitating dialog between the government and the opposition.\n\nIt is important that our response to Kazakhstan's request emphasize our readiness to cooperate and support in resolving the conflict, preserving peace and stability in the region. We must act in accordance with international norms and principles to help Kazakhstan overcome its difficulties and ensure the well-being of its people."

 centralkaz.12.a: "Interesting"
 centralkaz.13.t: "Protests ended, the government suppressed them together with CSTO forces"
 centralkaz.13.d: "The events that unfolded in Kazakhstan underscore the difficult balance between the right to peaceful protest and the need to maintain order and security in the country. The suppression of protests can leave a bitter taste in society and raise questions about the fairness and legality of the authorities' actions.\n\nThe CSTO intervention also raises questions about Kazakhstan's sovereignty and the influence of external actors on the country's internal affairs. It reminds us how difficult it is to balance national and international interests.\n\nNow that the protests are over, Kazakhstan has a long and difficult road ahead to rebuild trust within the country and on the world stage. It is important that the government act with respect for human rights and strive to find constructive ways to resolve the escalating problems."

The protests have just begun, but have already become a powerful manifestation of the people's will.\n\nProtesters, mostly youth and workers, took to the streets demanding political reforms and better living conditions.

 centraluzb.4.a: "Violently suppress the protests"
 centraluzb.4.b: "Hold democratic elections"
 centraluzb.5.t: "Results of protests in Andijan"
 centraluzb.5.d: "The events that took place in the Uzbek city of Andijan in May 2005 left an unforgettable trace in the history of Uzbekistan and caused a wide resonance in the international community. The Andijan riots were a real challenge to the Uzbek authorities and caused deep rifts in society.\n\nProtesters in Andijan demanded political reforms and freedom of speech, but the authorities' response was harsh and bloody. Footage and reports of the mass shootings attracted international media attention and led to international condemnation of Islam Karimov's regime.\n\nThe Andijan riots were a lesson to Uzbekistan about the need for dialog and the need to solve societal problems without resorting to violence. The events also emphasized the importance of respect for human rights and democratic values.\n\nFor the international community, the Andijan incident reminded the importance of supporting human rights and democratic initiatives in regions where they are violated. These events also emphasized the need for careful analysis and response to events occurring in countries with authoritarian regimes.\n\nThus, the Andijon riots were a tragic event, but they also drew attention to important human rights and democracy issues that remain relevant not only for Uzbekistan, but also for the entire global community..."

 centralkyr.8.d: "Today is a day that will forever go down in the history of Kyrgyzstan as the beginning of the Tulip Revolution. This day was marked by mass protests and civil activism that affected all corners of the country.\n\nA few days had passed since President Askar Akayev approved the reforms that caused discontent among the population. At first, no one could assume that these measures would push the country to the threshold of revolution. However, young people, students and ordinary citizens, united by a desire for change, took to the streets of the capital and other cities.\n\nSlogans demanding democracy, fair elections and freedom of speech were heard in Ala-Too Square and along the streets of Bishkek. Thousands of tulip flowers became a symbol of peace and hope for a better future. Several days of uninterrupted rallies and protests have passed, and it seems that this moving crisis has become a great revolution."

The streets of Kyrgyz cities remain the arena for the expression of people's anger and thirst for change.\n\nEvery day, more citizens take to the streets, inspired by the determination and solidarity of those on the front lines. Rallies and mass protests have become an integral part of everyday life. Ala-Too Square in Bishkek, as well as other public places, have become centers of activity where people voice their discontent and demand change.\n\nTulips, the symbol of revolution, are everywhere - in the hair of girls, on the lapels of coats and even on cars.

The administration building, which was previously inaccessible to ordinary citizens, is now under their control. This was a kind of triumph of popular will and a symbol that the government must serve the interests of the people.\n\nThe liberation of the administration building emphasizes the determination and solidarity of the Kyrgyz people, their willingness to fight for regime change and the establishment of democracy.

It speaks of the hope for a new beginning, where power will serve the interests of the people rather than epitomize despotism. It is an act that will remain in the memory of the Kyrgyz people as a symbol of the beginning of a new era in their country."

This moment symbolized the victory of the people over corruption and authoritarianism.\n\nA building that had previously served solely the interests of the regime now became a free space where the future of Kyrgyzstan could be discussed and shaped in the spirit of democracy.
