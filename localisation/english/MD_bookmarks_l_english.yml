 MODERN_DAY_NAME: "The World Today (OUTDATED)"
 MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Never has hunger been lower. Never has income been higher. Yet, the world is marked by fear in the face of rapid social and technological change. The backlash to globalization is felt as the Middle East collapses into hybrid warfare and a wave of nationalist populism rolls over the West. The gravity of the world is shifting towards Asia, but the emerging powers of the world have yet to find an attractive alternative to the prevailing Western world order."
 USA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The United States, the world's sole superpower, faces a gradual decline in international power. Bogged down in Middle Eastern wars, government debt and the economic rise of China and other BRICS nations, American hegemony is not what it once was. However, due to its unique geographic position offering it total safety with no natural enemies, it can remain engaged overseas in force to defend both the US and it's allies' vital interests. At home, a wave of nationalist sentiment against both elitism and globalization has left it with it's most unlikely president ever - Donald Trump.\nWith European and Asian allies fearing both American unilateralism and a withdrawal from Western liberal institutions, can the US strike a balance that will make the Western world order prevail?"
 ENG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The United Kingdom sits in a position that any country has ever been in before. The 2016 Brexit referendum passed at fifty-one, nearly, fifty-two percent majority and it has become the first and only country to invoke Article 50 of the European Union. It will stand in the history books as either the greatest decision for the British people or the worst possible choice.\nDeal or no deal is the greatest question."
 FRA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "A global center of art, culture, and diplomacy, France looks brightly upon a new century brimming with hope and opportunity. The tyranny of the ancient monarchies and the destruction of the World Wars have hurtled France towards the European Union, of which it is a founding member. \n\nOnly time will tell how the French will tackle the century ahead."
 GER_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Through austerity and reforms, the German economy remained unscathed from the dual shocks of the 2008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. As by far the strongest European economy, it has fallen on the once careful and unwilling Germany to lead the European Union forward in the face of Brexit and increased calls for national sovereignty. For Germany, the existence of the Eurozone and European Union is not a choice, but a necessity. European integration has produced a combined market large enough for its goods, as the strong German industrial sector has long since outstripped its internal demands. Furthermore, with a downward demographic trend, Germany must rely on increased immigration to fill the vacuum - a choice that is sure to be controversial with nationalism on the rise."
 JAP_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Japan is one of the world’s largest economies. It continues to outproduce many countries in Europe, and it also maintains one of the world’s most unique cultures. However, this large economy is plagued by incredible amounts of debt. The population of Japan and government is trending to around two hundred and forty-nine percent of its GDP. Furthermore, it is also one of few countries that is affected by an inverted population pyramid where the majority of its population is well over their forties.\nWill Japan collapse under its financial debt and population crisis or will it stand the test of time and become one of the strongest countries in the world?"
 SOV_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The fall of the Soviet Union reversed 300 years of Russian expansionism and left the new federation with its 17th Century borders. The expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe and post-Soviet states has left it vulnerable, as it's heartland lies on the European plain - which is indefensible. Thus, gaining indirect control over post-Soviet states such as Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltics via initiatives such as the Eurasian Union is paramount if Russia is to ever again amount to anything more than a regional power with a decent military. Economically, she must overcome the dual shocks of low oil prices and western sanctions, and somehow tackle the rampant corruption in Russia's highly centralized bureaucracy."
 CHI_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "China's geography - surrounded by mountains and jungles - protects it, but also isolates it from the rest of the world. As a multi-ethnic empire with large minorities, just maintaining it's territorial integrity takes considerable effort, as it needs to provide massive investments in its hinterlands and disputed territories in order to maintain control. It's perhaps largest vulnerability, however, is its dependence on exports and trade on the open ocean - which is controlled by the United States and its Asian-Pacific allies. For China to become a true superpower, it needs to compete with the US Navy in size and quality and to turn current Asian rivals into allies. China's diplomacy is hampered by its lack of an attractive political model. However, it is boosted by its massive foreign reserves and its willingness to use them to invest abroad."
 BRA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Brazil is slowly on the rise at the turn of the century. The country has the potential for greatness. It is one of the world's largest emerging economies and its growth has continued to accelerate. However, in recent years Brazil's economic current is reeling back from a harsh recession due to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1995 and a crippled currency. Now a new party contender has arrived on the scene. The PT has swapped in and is quickly gaining traction.\n\nWill you be able to kickstart the country's once great economy or will the PT and its socialist policies seize hold?"
 UKR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The year 2014 made Ukraine the epicenter of events that could at any time lead to irreversible consequences. The dignity revolution overthrew Viktor Yanukovich’s authoritarian power and brought a new pro-Western government headed by Petro Poroshenko. Despite many campaign promises, the newly elected guarantor led the country into an even bigger debt trap and took advantage of the situation for its benefit. The people's patience is running out. The Crimean peninsula was annexed by our former friends, and the eastern regions of Donbas are swept up by the flames of war. Only a few years are left before the new elections, but will the people endure until the end of the presidential term?"
 TUR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Recent years haven't been forgiving. Although PKK threat has been nearly eliminated, we couldn't come up with a solution to end it fully. It has been mere months since the coup attempt has been repelled and although some people even starting to forget it, some perpetrators are still at large, few of them still inside our country, some has been hiding abroad or being sheltered by our enemies, including, the head of the snake, Fethullah Gülen. And all the while some circles have been circulating rumors that Erdogan himself orchestrated the coup and made it fail in purpose to get rid of opposition and seize more power. Nonetheless, a portion of people that got purged have turned out to be innocent and these mistaken convictions are proven."
 ISR_2000_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "In some ways Israel has never been in a better position. The existential threat that Israel's Arab neighbors once posed has largely faded away thanks to the normalization of relations with Egypt and Jordan. Great steps were taken towards resolving the Palestinian question through the Oslo Accords of 1993.\n\nDespite this, Israel remains uneasy. Terrorism and rogue states justify the continued securitization of the country, as questions about the future trajectory of the Jewish state continue to dominate Israeli politics. How Israel will respond to the growing and often incompatible pressures from the international community, Palestinians, and its own people remains uncertain."
 ISR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With the oncoming departure of President Obama, Israel is hopeful for a return to the status quo in the Middle East. Recent years have seen Israel threatened by America's pivot to Asia, widespread instability following the Arab Spring, and a resurgent Iran. Many in the Israeli government hope that the new President will revitalize America's commitment to Israeli defence and put an end to efforts to reintegrate Iran into the international community.\n\nBut regardless of the US's position towards Israel and the Middle East at large, deep structural tensions within Israel and the wider region remain, ones that will not be resolved simply by relying on America's unwavering support."
 SYR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With divided loyalties in the Syrian Armed Forces and staggering losses from 6 years of fighting a brutal civil war, the regular Army is a spent force. Its place on the Syrian battlefield has been taken by wide array of militias, private military companies, Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who together have begun to reverse Assad's losses. However, with its economy destroyed, and most of Syria's territory under the control of terrorists, rebels and Kurds, the prospect of a united Syria looks certain to be a long struggle ahead."
 SYR_2000_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Syria has been under the dictatorship of the al-Assad family since 1971. Hafez al-Assad's health is currently failing, and soon a new successor will rise. Many of Hafez's children and relatives are vying for power but only one can rule."
 PER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic Republic established in 1979 has ruled over Iran as an Shi'ite Islamic Theocracy. From West to East, Iran has faced many issues, such as the Afghani civil war in the East, and Western hostility to the Shi'ite way of life. With such hostility, Iran has cemented itself as a beacon of Shia activities in the Muslim world, with wide reaching influence in extremist organizations such as Hezbollah, who relies heavily on Iranian monetary support for continued activities. However, with rising tensions amongst the political atmosphere, the regimes future is uncertain. Ultimately, if Iran is to survive, it will either have to cooperate with on the global front and with neighbors, or it will have to crush its opponents. Only time will tell what it chooses to do..."
 PER_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "After continuing the AMAD project amidst global retaliation, Iran had faced harsh economic sanctions that had debilitated, but not stopped, its march for the acquisition of nuclear weapons. During this time of hardship, Iran had also begun to flex its power in the Middle East with the use of its Quds Force. Now beginning to bounce back, Iran has postured itself as a nation willing to stand up to the global order, and to the United States. Where will it go from here?"
 FSA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Initially the Free Syrian Army was a umbrella-organization of anti-Assad rebel groups and a true government in parallel. However, radicalization of Syrian militants led to mass defections to both Al-Qaeda ally Al-Nusra and ISIS, contributing to the eradication of the FSA in the north of Syria. As a result, the Free Syrian Army was dismantled as an organization. However, a wide array of Muslim Brotherhood linked rebel groups together with smatterings of Salafists and secular groups still retain the label. In the South of Syria, FSA-affiliated groups have been successful in desert warfare against ISIS, and still defend most of Dara'a from Assad's forces. In the north, the Turkish Army intervention has been successful in creating a wedge between the two Kurdish cantons."
 NUS_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "In January of 2017 multiple Mujahideen factions united under the call to a unified Jihad against the tyrant Al-Assad. Known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the Levant Liberation Committee, this formidable organization was formed in the bloodshed of the Syrian civil war. The group is classified by the U.S.A as a terrorist organization and an al-Qaeda affiliated organization."
 ROJ_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "As the Syrian Civil War began, Assad's forces withdrew from the Kurdish areas to defend its heartland. This allowed the long repressed Kurdish people, through the left-wing Democratic Union Party and it's militia, the YPG, to take control and establish Rojava, based on democratic socialism and gender equality. As ISIS entered the Syrian battlefield, they targeted the Kurds with force, taking over large swaths of Rojava, culminating in the failed assault on Kobane. With reinforcements from the Peshmerga, the Turkish PKK and US air support, the Kurds were able to turn the tide and send ISIS on the run. Since then, it has incorporated parts of the old FSA under the banner of the \"SDF\". However, it's future challenges remain numerous, with Turkey repeatedly threatening war and fears looming that the tacit alliance with Assad might break down into conflict."
 OTHER_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 DEN_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Denmark is a safe and secure nation, being both a member of the EU and NATO. However, an internal economic downturn and slowdown has recently begun challenging the Danish state. Whether Denmark can continue to remain immune from the turbulence of the wider world is far from certain."
 ETH_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption."
 FIN_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European integrationist project. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and has also adopted the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 ITA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After its defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought it back up to the status of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"
 GRE_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Greece is in turmoil following the 2008 recession which further weakened its already fragile economy. The increasing debt to GDP ratio combined with tensions due to the rise of radical parties makes Greece's condition worsen by the day. Furthermore, Greece and Turkey still have sour relations, meaning that any minor incident could potentially drive the two countries towards war.\n\nGreece finds itself teetering on the edge of collapse, with even the smallest decision potentially making or breaking the country. Let us hope you make the right choices."
 NOR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to a certain extent. Nonetheless, the country remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation, a powerful neighbor that it must necessarily be wary of."
 SWE_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing little to alleviate its issues. The Swedish nation, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers to its current troubles."
 POL_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Poland has grown massively since its arrival to the European Union in 2004. It is now a regional power and one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. It is on course to become one of the most significant powers in Europe. Poland's current political situation is an interesting one as PiS has gotten into power and relations with the EU have gotten heated. A staunchly anti-Russian country, Poland has made a large effort into strengthening its relations with the United States."
 SWI_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Neutral since time immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of both NATO and the European Union. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 BRM_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Aung Saan Suu Kyi, once the darling of the international community, has seen a dramatic reversal of fortunes in terms of international public opinion. No longer the charismatic and eloquent human rights campaigner, the Rohingya Crisis has transformed Myanmar's de facto leader into a vilified war criminal in the eyes of many. Within the country's territorial boundaries, rebel groups and still powerful military generals watch for signs of weakness. These twin dilemmas, international and domestic, present the government of Myanmar with important choices. Permit or halt the violence against the Muslims of Rakhine. Attempt to restore relations with the West, or fall back on the military junta's old ally, China. The answer is far from clear."
 NIG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Nigeria's last ten years have shown the true colors of the Islamic State as it supports the major uprising of Boko Haram and the Salafist rebels in the North East of Nigeria. The military of Nigeria proved incredibly ineffective at fighting in the new kind of guerilla warfare. It has slowly grown into a major regional conflict as the Nigerian government is slowly losing more and more control over of the state of Borno.\n Will you end the insurgency or join the global jihad?"
 BHR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Bahrain is a nation that did not escape the wave of protests that spread throughout the Middle East as part of the so-called \"Arab Spring\". The Day of Rage saw the Shi'a majority vent its frustration against a monarchy that is perceived not only as discriminatory towards the Shi'a but also as a foreign occupier and an oppressor of the true, indigenous Bahraini people. Without the intervention of Peninsula Shield, the monarchy may well have collapsed in 2011.\n\nThe Khalifa dynasty's priority is therefore the preservation of its rule in the face of Shi'a hostility. While historically the Sunni opposition posed a greater threat, the specter of Iranian influence and limited political liberalization mean that this threat has been subdued, at least for now."
 KUW_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Kuwait enjoys a relatively comfortable position internationally. The greatest threat to its sovereignty, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, was eliminated by the American invasion of 2003, and Kuwait has managed to maintain good relations with all of the Middle East's regional players.\n\nKuwait's biggest challenge, although not an urgent one, is internal in nature. The country's system of semi-democratic rule has bolstered the government's legitimacy but has prevented the reforms necessary to diversify Kuwait's oil-dependent economy. Moreover, Kuwait's reforms have not completely placated the opposition, who continue to oppose government censorship and the occasional repression of political activists."
 OMA_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Oman has earned a reputation as a beacon of peace and stability in a restless and conflict-prone region. Qaboos bin Said al Said has pursued a successful foreign policy since he took power in 1970, leading a country that is hated by none and admired by all. But Oman is not without its challenges. The Sultan has been criticized for his heavy-handed approach towards internal dissent, raising uncertainty about the sustainability of the absolute monarchy. Moreover, the war in Yemen has opened up a new threat. Oman has historically considered the Yemeni province of al-Mahra part of its sphere of influence, given the region's close cultural links to Dhofar in Oman. But the presence of Saudi troops threatens Oman's border and will not be tolerated by the Omani state, even if it means secretly undermining the Saudi war effort."
 QAT_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Since 1996 Qatar has charted an independent course within the Gulf Cooperation Council. The country's natural gas reserves has allowed Qatar to operate outside of the Saudi-dominated oil market, and for decades the emirs of Qatar have enjoyed a close relationship to the populist Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that the Saudis and Emiratis have increasingly come to see as a threat to their authority. As the home of Al-Jazeera, Qatar is partially blamed by the other Arab autocracies for the spread of the Arab uprisings collectively known as the Arab Spring. Worst of all in the eyes of the Saudis and their Emirati allies is Qatar's close relationship with Iran, a state that they view as an existential threat. It is only a matter of time before the hostility of Qatar's neighbors to its unique foreign policy reaches boiling point."
 SAU_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The Saudis have watched as the Middle East was irrevocably transformed by a series of momentous events. First the events of 2003 eliminated a major player in the power struggle between Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran and inflamed sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi'a as a result of the subsequent civil war. Then the Saudis watched in horror as friendly regimes across the Arab world were toppled by the phenomenon known as the Arab Spring. And finally, the Saudis anxiously observed America's gradual withdrawal from the region and its rapprochement with Iran under Obama. All this has convinced the Saudis of the need for a more proactive foreign policy, one that has led the monarchy to aggressively counter Iranian influence across the Middle East. From Lebanon to Yemen, from Syria to Iraq, battle lines are being drawn."
 SIN_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "The financial sector in Singapore has exploded in recent years. The country has slowly absorbed the limelight of South East Asia as a role model for other nations in the region. Its pro-business legislature has allowed it to maintain incredible growth and to become one of the wealthiest nations on the planet by GDP/C. The Lion City continues to explode and expand, but China has dwarfed this city and remains an ever present threat looming on the horizon."
 PHI_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Economically speaking the Philippines has been dubbed one of the newly industrialized nations as it continues to maintain growth rates of at least 5%. Being one of the Tiger Cub Economies it has been able to maintain a presence on the list of important emerging markets. Recently with the election of 2016, Rodrigo Duterte has taken power and with many promises to continue an aggressive war against the Cartels and a softening stance against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front stating that the Moros have been unjustly treated and seeks to expand their representation.\n"
 UAE_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Fondly nicknamed by American officials as \"Little Sparta\", the United Arab Emirates has been a close ally to both the United States and Saudi Arabia and an eager participant in multilateral military operations. The Emirati armed forces, particularly its reputable air force and its elite Presidential Guard, has seen service in Afghanistan, Libya, Kosovo, Somalia and now Yemen. But the UAE is not content to simply play second fiddle to the US or Saudi Arabia. The Emiratis have punched above their weight in terms of foreign influence, at times competing with its erstwhile allies for example by throwing its weight behind separatists in Yemen temporarily allied to the Saudi-backed Hadi government. Moreover, the UAE is home to the only successful case of economic diversification, Dubai having earned a reputation as a global city and a financial hub."
 CAN_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Having gained complete independence from the UK in 1982, Canada is the 4th largest exporter of oil in the world and has proven to be one of the leading countries in counter-terror operations. With the second largest landmass in the world, Canada is made up of mostly ice plains and mountains with the majority of the population residing in the south of the country. With a vast amount of resources at its disposal, Canada is a country with endless possibility and potential."
 KOR_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Korea is in the midst of one of the most dramatic presidential scandals in its history. Following massive demonstrations, conservative President Park Geun-hye has just been impeached by the National Assembly due to the shadowy influence of her Rasputin-esque advisor, Choi Soon-sil. With the ruling party in chaos and fresh elections likely to be called in a few months, the stage seems set for the left-wing Democratic Party to make a return to power.\n\nIf presidential hopeful Moon Jae-in makes it to the Blue House, he will need to restore faith in the Korean political system, achieve an ambitious economic agenda, and manage what are likely to be tense relations between the US and North Korea following the US presidential election."
 NKO_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Many underestimated the young, portly Kim Jong-un when the time came for him to assume his father's position as Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic. It has since become clear that this Swiss-educated, poorly-understood figure was a force to be reckoned with. His brutal consolidation of power featured the execution of Kim's uncle and a host of other officials including, if reports are to be believed, one execution by anti-aircraft cannon. But the young Kim's position is not entirely secure. Dissent within the ranks of the establishment remain, and his ambitious economic reform agenda is still gathering steam. Will the latest iteration of the North's Kim Dynasty sustain the state as his father and grandfather did? Or will he witness the collapse of his kingdom?"
 BOT_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Botswana is one of the most highly developed countries in Africa with a stable democracy, high human development index and low corruption. Botswana gained its wealth after large amounts of diamonds were found, which lead to one of the highest GDP per capita in Africa. However, it is not without its problems; the politics are dominated by the BDP party, whom many see as autocratic and exclusive. In addition, poaching is rampant in the country's many game reserves. Diamonds are also not going to last forever, and a solution needs to be found to find alternatives for the economy."
 AFG_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "With the help of coalition forces, the Northern Alliance successfully toppled the Taliban regime. Instead of being annihilated, the Taliban have since fragmented and begun waging an insurgency in various parts of Afghanistan, they still pose a significant threat to coalition and government forces. While some actions of the coalition forces are reasons for the Taliban's growth, the inefficiency and corruption of the central government and Afghanistan's unique pre-modern tribal culture are the main reasons why the Taliban are difficult to annihilate, not to mention the fact that Taliban militants can hide and regroup in parts of Pakistan and go return to the fight in Afghanistan. Will government forces end the Taliban insurgency? Or will there be a peace deal to convince the Taliban to peacefully lay down their arms and join the government?"
 LIC_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Liechtenstein is a small and unassuming but well developed nation in the heart of Europe. With a population of only six thousand and one of the only two double-landlocked nations in the world, it's safe to say that nobody expects much from Liechtenstein. Heavily dependant on its neighbors in the alps for both its economy and security, Liechtenstein has many difficult choices ahead of it. Should it be a bastion of international cooperation, or a haven for ill-intentioned international corporations? Should it accept refugees from around the world in an attempt to become a real military power, or close its borders and focus only on itself. Only time will tell."

 MILLENNIUM_DAWN: "Millennium Dawn"
 MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The world has changed. Globally speaking, an atmosphere of peace and prosperity has ruled for about half a century. But with the recent end of the Cold War and the rise of the People's Republic of China, how will this world see itself? How will it shape itself? Will the United States continue its dominance? Will the new Russian Federation find its way into the spotlight? What roles will the former great European empires of Britain, France and Germany play? And what role will the shadow of terrorism have? The world has changed. The world is changing."
 CHI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The backwater of yesterday. The superpower of tomorrow. After decades of European bullying and even more decades of civil war, strife, and invasion by the Japanese, China looks to rebuild itself as the foremost power of Asia, and eventually, the world. \n\nUnder the leadership of the Communist Party, great strides have been made in building a new China. But this new China is volatile. If China reforms too slowly; it may be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly; it might destroy itself."
 FRA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "A global center of art, culture, and diplomacy, France looks brightly upon a new century brimming with hope and opportunity. The tyranny of the ancient monarchies and the destruction of the World Wars have hurtled France towards the European Union, of which it is a founding member. \n\nOnly time will tell how the French will tackle the century ahead."
 GER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The retreat of the Soviets and the reunification of East and West Germany have given new hope to the nation. Germany’s traumatic past and the horrors of fascism have not been lost on the general populace. Now, Germany stands as one of the most democratic nations in Europe, with a robust social welfare system and one of the strongest economies in Europe. \n\nA founding member of the European Union, Germany looks towards expanding the bloc to include the former Soviet states of Eastern Europe against a possible Russian resurgence."
 JAP_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "A land of roughly 6,852 islands, the maritime people of Japan have come far since the Second World War and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Today, Japan stands as the second-largest economy on Earth, renowned for its technological innovation and quality products shipped across the world. \n\nBacked by its American and European allies, Japan looks warily at its old rival China with both newfound confidence and new potential for conflict."
 SOV_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The August Coup and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has left the Russian economy in tatters, its pride shaken, and its future looking grim. Oligarchs and corrupt officials have filled the vacuum of power in the absence of a strong central authority. \n\nThe recent rise of Vladimir Putin has many wondering how this ex-KGB officer will attempt to restore Russia’s legacy and bring it forward into a new age."
 ENG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has bid farewell to its last great colonial possession. The once mightiest nation on Earth is desperately trying to redefine itself and find a new path to greatness and glory. \n\nWill that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?"
 USA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The collapse of the Soviet Union has led to the world’s first unipolar moment. The United States stands at the forefront of all technological, military, and cultural forces at work across the globe. Its reach has never been greater, and its future has never looked brighter. \n\nThe upcoming elections will prove a crucial moment in determining the future course of America; and for better or worse, the world."
 TUR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War One, Turkey has largely remained in the backdrop of geopolitical affairs. Now, Turkey’s position puts it in the spotlight once again, as competing ideologies work to shift the country one way or the other. \n\nShould the Republic continue with Atatürk's reforms and seek recognition with the EU, or remain true to its Islamic heritage? The failing health of Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit signals uncertain times ahead."
 UKR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The elections of 1999 were supposed to bring an unconditional victory to the liberal leader of the National Movement - Viacheslav Chornovil. But soon, he died in a car accident under mysterious circumstances. The current president, Leonid Kuchma, won the election in the wake of truthful slogans and lack of populist promises. But what his cadence will bring is still questionable. \n\nAfter being deprived of its nuclear status in 1996 and signing the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine received guarantees of protection from the strongest states and a ticket to the world theater. But who will the young country be at the future performance? A direct participant or merely an observer in the last rows?"

Once a British colony, now an independent rising power, it is at odds with its northern and western neighbor. The conflict in Kashmir has built the entire geopolitical paradigm of India for years to come. Now, as India enters a new century, it must finally rise from its knees and show the full might of the Asian Tiger. Can India become a superpower or will it fall into a long decline? And what does the coming millennium hold for it?"
 SPR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of fascism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain, and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing little to alleviate its issues. The Swedish nation, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers to its current troubles."
 SWI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Neutral since time immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 BRM_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Myanmar stands at a crossroads at the start of the 21st century. The military junta has come to realize that its grip on power is steadily loosening, as pressure from both within and without to democratize grows ever stronger. However, democratization or lack thereof is not the only issue before Myanmar's government. The territorial integrity of this Southeast Asian nation has been shaky ever since independence, with rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy plaguing Myanmar's border regions. The solutions to these twin dilemmas remain unclear. Violence or diplomacy? Democracy or authoritarianism? Compromise or revolution? Only time will tell."
 LIC_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Liechtenstein is a small and unassuming but well developed nation in the heart of Europe. With a population of only six thousand and one of the only two double-landlocked nations in the world, it's safe to say that nobody expects much from Liechtenstein. Heavily dependant on its neighbors in the alps for both its economy and security, Liechtenstein has many difficult choices ahead of it. Should it be a bastion of international cooperation, or a haven for ill-intentioned international corporations? Should it accept refugees from around the world in an attempt to become a real military power, or close its borders and focus only on itself. Only time will tell."
 POL_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Poland has recently broken free from the communist bloc of the Soviet Union. The current situation in the country is far from perfect. Despite the growth of the Polish economy since the fall of communism, the people of Poland continue to struggle. Despite these difficulties, the nation itself has a lot of potential to become a significant economic power. Taking advantage of the chaos, two rival parties have entered the political arena: the Eurosceptical PiS and the PO faithful to the European Union. The different views of these parties may make Poland a Central European economic power, or alienate its neighbors and re-enter the path of conquest. In addition, there was an opportunity to unite the famous Visegrad Group, where Poland, as the strongest of these 4 countries, may decide on the final connection of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary under one flag. But when the two largest political parties fight against each other, some are just waiting to come out of the shadows. The nationalist UPR party, led by Janusz Korwin-Mikke, may prove to be the winner in this duel, which will bring huge changes to Poland. However, a nationalist will not take the throne so easily. Lech Wałęsa, former leader of the anti-communist Solidarity, which overthrew communism in Poland, is now still present in politics with his ChDRP party and will make every effort to ensure that Korwin does not plunge the country into chaos."
 NIG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Nigeria at the turn of the century has slowly gained international primacy as its large population and bankers continue to expand their hold in foreign markets. Furthermore, they have begun to participate more in the local region as their newfound liberal democracy has started to grow in popularity. However, Nigerian democracy is now strained by the emergence of Sharia Law in its northern states, threatening the stability of the nation. Outrage and protests have exploded amongst the Christian populace. \nWill the growing popularity of Islam cause war in the country?"
 BHR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The newly crowned emir of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, inherits a precarious position. Bahrain's Shi'a majority harbors significant frustration towards a monarchy that is perceived not only as discriminatory towards the Shi'a but also as a foreign occupier and an oppressor of the true, indigenous Bahraini people. The Sunni opposition, for albeit different reasons, resents the autocratic nature of Bahraini government, and has aligned itself with Shi'a groups opposed to a continuation of the absolute monarchy. Some of the emir's advisors have pushed for political liberalization as a way to reduce the pressure placed on the regime, while others have advocated a strengthening of autocratic rule. It will be up to Bahrain's new ruler to chart a course for the country."
 KUW_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Not too long ago Kuwait was a country under occupation. Its monarchy was in exile campaigning for a restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty, while the people of Kuwait, both Sunni and Shi'a, were united against the Iraqi oppressor. Now that the Gulf War has restored Kuwaiti independence, the monarchy must resume the political balancing act that is ruling the nation of Kuwait. Kuwait's parliament, one of the most powerful in the Middle East, places a powerful check on the monarch's authority while continually pressing for greater political liberalization. The country's influential merchant class continues to push for greater investment in the private sector, something that public sector-employed Kuwaiti citizens are reluctant to see happen at the expense of their own welfare."
 OMA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Oman has earned a reputation as a beacon of peace and stability in a restless and conflict-prone region. Qaboos bin Said al Said has pursued a successful foreign policy since he took power in 1970, leading a country that is hated by none and admired by all. But Oman is not without its challenges. The Sultan has been criticized for his heavy-handed approach towards internal dissent, raising uncertainty about the sustainability of the absolute monarchy."
 QAT_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since 1996 Qatar has charted an independent course within the Gulf Cooperation Council. The country's natural gas reserves has allowed Qatar to operate outside of the Saudi-dominated oil market, and for decades the emirs of Qatar have enjoyed a close relationship to the populist Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that the Saudis and Emiratis have increasingly come to see as a threat to their authority. Worst of all in the eyes of the Saudis and their Emirati allies is Qatar's close relationship with Iran, a state that they view as an existential threat. It is only a matter of time before the hostility of Qatar's neighbors to its unique foreign policy reaches boiling point."
 SAU_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Saudi Arabia has historically enjoyed a comfortable position as one of the Middle East's leading powers. As custodian of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, the Kingdom enjoys unparalleled religious legitimacy. However, the Iranian Revolution of 1979 transformed mutual Saudi-Iranian suspicion into outright hostility as the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran sought to claim the mantle of leader of the Islamic world. Internally too the Kingdom faces challengers for the title of leader of the Islamic world. Since the Saudis allowed American troops into the country in 1991, the al-Qaeda leadership has sworn to destroy the Saudi monarchy and its false piety and replace it with a truly Islamic government."
 SIN_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Singapore at the turn of the century held at most regional authority amongst the nations of Asia and abroad. The Asian financial crisis also did no favors to the small nation at the mouth of the Malay peninsula. Outside of the financial crisis and its small stature it has shown its strength in the entrepot, banking and foreign investment. The Singaporean people and her government have shown truly what is like to be dubbed the \"The Lion City\"\n"
 PHI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The recent election of 1998, has seen a massive change in rhetoric within the Filipino political spectrum. Estrada and his coalition, Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Struggle of the Patriotic Filipino Masses), saw resounding success against his opposition. Underneath Estrada the Philippines saw a resounding growth rate of 3.4% and is set on track to maintain the quick-paced growth. Furthermore, Estrada has begun mobilizing the AFP to prepare an declaration of all-out-war on the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Hidden amongst this almost picturesque presidency lurks the monster of corruption and an subsequent trail."
 UAE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Fondly nicknamed by American officials as \"Little Sparta\", the United Arab Emirates has been a close ally to both the United States and Saudi Arabia and an eager participant in multilateral military operations. The Emirati armed forces, particularly its reputable air force and its elite Presidential Guard, has seen service in the Gulf War, accumulating useful military experience.\n\nBut the UAE is not content to simply play second fiddle to the US or Saudi Arabia. The Emiratis have punched above their weight in terms of foreign influence, at times competing with its erstwhile allies. Moreover, the UAE is home to the only successful case of economic diversification, Dubai having earned a reputation as a global city and a financial hub."
 KOR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The Republic of Korea has successfully overcome war, poverty, and dictatorship to become one of the most developed and stable countries in the world. President Kim Dae-jung is widely respected for his role in bringing democracy to Korea and many are hopeful about his efforts to make peace with the North.\n\nHowever, his administration has been tainted by scandal and Korean politics remains exceedingly polarized. Political partisanship, government corruption, and uncertainty surrounding the president's efforts to reconcile with the North will define Korea's future in this new millennium."
 NKO_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The so-called \"Hermit Kingdom\" is a place that the outside world perceives as mysterious and threatening in equal measure. Rumblings of a secret nuclear program in the country are proliferating and its southern neighbor remains suspicious of the North's intentions. But cracks have started showing in the Hermit Kingdom's impenetrable image. Still in the process of recovering from a devastating famine known as the Arduous March, the DPRK has had to rely on external assistance to help weather the storm. The weaknesses of the North's system of governance are patently clear. Will Kim Jong-il address these shortcomings, and adopt a diplomatic approach to the outside world to facilitate development? Or will he decide that the bellicosity of the army and the ideological fervor of the party must be sustained by war?"
 BOT_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Botswana is one of the most highly developed countries in Africa with a stable democracy, high human development index and low corruption. Botswana gained its wealth after large amounts of diamonds were found, which lead to one of the highest GDP per capita in Africa. However, it is not without its problems; the politics are dominated by the BDP party, whom many see as autocratic and exclusive. In addition, poaching is rampant in the country's many game reserves. Diamonds are also not going to last forever, and a solution needs to be found to find alternatives for the economy."
 AFG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the communists took power in 1978, Afghanistan has been in a cycle of civil war and external intervention. The 1989 withdrawal of the Soviet Union and the subsequent fall of the regime in 1992 did not bring peace. Rather, the conflict of interests between the Mujahideen factions led to continued fighting until 1996, when the Pakistani-backed Taliban took advantage of the civil war to seize large parts of Afghanistan. Their goal was to eliminate all other factions, forcing the former warlords to form the Northern Alliance against the Taliban under the mediation of General Massoud. What does the future hold for this war-torn country?"
 ARM_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The independence of Armenia, which it received one of the first after the collapse of the USSR, did not bring it any prosperity or greatness. The war in Nagorno-Karabakh, unleashed by the nationalists, bled the republic dry. At the same time, not so much the hostilities themselves as the blockade of Armenia by Azerbaijan. At the helm of Armenia is a controversial politician who has great influence both in Armenia itself and in the disputed Artsakh. Will Armenia be able to gain glory under his rule, or will it slide into a long-term abyss?"
 BLR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The collapse of the Soviet Union brought Belarus long-awaited independence. But was it worth it? The economy is completely dependent on Russia, the army is not combat-ready, and the West is still looking at how to turn Belarus into a stronghold of anti-Russian sentiment. Will Lukashenko or anyone else be able to choose the right path for Belarus?"
 GEO_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Georgia, left on the sidelines of the Caucasus after the collapse of the USSR, fell into a civil war almost simultaneously with the war in Abkhazia and Ossetia. The overthrow of President Gamsakhurdia led to political instability, dashed hopes for a united Georgia and left a big imprint on the people. Will Georgia be able to become a regional power or will it continue to move towards political chaos?"
 AZE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Azerbaijan, now headed by the authoritative former communist Heydar Aliyev, is at a crossroads. The lost war in Artsakh, an unstable society and the growing ambitions of the people, put the government of Azerbaijan in front of an uncertain future. Will it be able to become the pearl of the Caucasus, or will it slide into political instability?"
 COM_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "The Comorosi island chain has an idyllic countryside. Jungles covers the mountains and the volcano Karthala. Its on the coast where most people live simple lives as fishermen, the country's single greatest revenue. Not always is it peaceful on these islands. Coups are common occurance and unruly governors try their best for more autonomy. Comoros does share a lot with its cultural neighbour Tanzania, except its majority muslim and all exclusivly speak a dialect of Kiswahili.\n\nThe country has an interesting view on the french overseas department of Mayotte. Irredentists claim it as part of the nation though the people in Mayotte doesn't seem to share that view."
 COM_MODERN_DAY_DESC: "Comoros has seen its fair share of action. In 2008 the invasion to take back control of Anjouan was a success. Many citizens regrettably live in poor lives with many fleeing to Mayotte in search for a better life. There's some good prospectsfor a membership in the East African Community. This can greatly improve investment opportunities to come to Comoros and raise the living standards for thousands. Most likely this country will live life with business as usual."
 ABK_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Abkhazia is a small country that has been fighting for its independence for a long time. Back in 1993, this country won its right to independence, although no one except Russia recognized it for its rights. Perhaps soon the whole world will hear about Abkhazia"
 EST_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Estonia, officially known as the Republic of Estonia, celebrates its ninth year of independence from the Soviet Union; however, this does not mean that Russian influence continues to grow. The small baltic country is now caught between the ever-growing pull of the East and West. It now has to contend with threats to its independence, the rise of far-right thought, and ineffective government bureaucracy causing issues within the country."
 FIJ_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Fiji, also known as the Republic of Fiji, is a Pacific island nation which has had a strikingly volatile history. Gaining independence in the 1970s, Fiji has had 2 coups and several changes of both government and constitutions which have only been enhanced through the growing ethnic divide between the Ethnic Fijians and the Ethnic Indo-Fijian peoples. But with the new millennia comes new problems, only time will tell if Fiji can truly become the island paradise that she sells herself as."
 KAZ_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Kazakhstan, the last nation which emerged from the shadow of the Soviet Union, marked by growing economic downfall driven by its collapsed statehood. As the new millennium dawned, questions about its political and economic trajectory lingered. What future awaited Kazakhstan in the 21st century, and how would it balance its aspirations for modernization with preserving its unique cultural identity?"
 KYR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Kyrgyzstan is a young and politically unstable nation in Central Asia, marked by a series of political upheavals. Another new autocrat managed to take power into his own hands. Will he be able to retain power amid the flaring conflict with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan? What role will Russia and China play in this? All this awaits Kyrgyzstan in the new millennium."
 UZB_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "In the year 2000, Uzbekistan is a former Soviet republic characterized by a centralized, authoritarian government. Its economy was primarily based on agriculture and cotton production. As the new millennium began, one could ponder: What future would Uzbekistan embrace in the 21st century? Would it evolve politically, economically, and socially, and how would it navigate its role in a changing Central Asian landscape?"
 VEN_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "At the onset of the new millennium, Venezuela stood at a crossroads, shaped by a rich and intricate history that carried a blend of promise and uncertainty. The year 2000 marked a significant juncture in the country's evolution, following a series of momentous political and social shifts. In 1999, Hugo Chávez, a charismatic military leader, ascended to the presidency of Venezuela. His election represented a profound turning point in the nation's narrative. Chávez's ascent was propelled by a commitment to confront enduring challenges of social inequality, poverty, and political corruption. Under the banner of Chavismo, his political movement, he championed a vision for a more just and equitable distribution of Venezuela's abundant oil wealth. However, as the new millennium unfolded, the nation found itself at a pivotal moment, with the future direction of Venezuela hanging in the balance. There were growing debates and diverging perspectives on whether to continue under Chávez's leadership or explore an alternative path. Some advocated for an extension of Chávez's tenure, emphasizing his mission to address social inequalities, while others argued for a different course, seeking fresh approaches to governance and economic stability. Will we see a change in government in Venezuela's future? Or will we see the continuation of the Fifth Republic?"
 HEZ_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Since the start of the Lebanese Civil War and the occurrence of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, an orthodox organization which was originally a part of the Islamic Amal movement of Lebanon, and its ideals was and is based on the doctrine of the \"Islamic Resistance\" ,was formed. The Hezbollah, the most powerful political and military entity in Lebanon, was formed. From those times, Hezbollah adjusted itself to be a leverage against the state of Israel and its allies in the Levant region. Although at the same time, it tries to have a dominance over the state of Lebanon itself. With  tensions in the middle east growing up since the Persian Gulf War, Hezbollah has tried to increase its base of operations beyond the Middle East. And now, with  the rise of tensions on the region once again, Hezbollah has to adjust its new plans, would the doctrine of the Resistance, and the political dominance of Hezbollah in Lebanon succeed? Only time and the changes of the world would tell... "
 OTHER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
