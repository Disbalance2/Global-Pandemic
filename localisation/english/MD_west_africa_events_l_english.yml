 ivory_coast_md.1.t: "Promise of Elections"
 ivory_coast_md.1.d: "On the 24 December 1999 former president Henri Konan Bédié was deposed in a military coup. Since then the Ivory Coast has been run by the National Public Salvation Committee, a military junta. Many Ivorians welcomed the coup, saying that they hoped the army would improve Ivory Coast's shaky economic and political circumstances, but now there is pressure for a return to civilian rule. The question is whether we should permit migrant workers, who make up most of the north's population to stand for election"

The coalition consists of the [liberalism_L], [Western_Autocracy_L], [conservatism_L], and [socialism_L] parties have banded together to defeat the [neutral_Social_L]. Their combined opposition strength ([?opposition_strength|Y2%]) compared to the [neutral_Social_L] ([?party_pop_array^18|Y2%]) is landing the opposition firmly in the lead. How should we proceed heading into these elections?\n"
