 upgrade_blueprint_stealing: "Industrial Espionage"
 upgrade_blueprint_stealing_desc: "§WWe know that our enemy has secret projects for experimental weapons and vehicles, what we do not know is exactly what those projects are and what they are building. By hacking the experimental weapons departments of our enemies, we will not only gain the opportunity to learn precisely what they plan to use against us, we will also be given the unique opportunity to use this information to advance our own weapons department.§!"
 upgrade_portable_radios: "Secured Communication"
 upgrade_portable_radios_desc: "§WWhen our agents are in the field. it is absolutely essential that they are able to communicate without the fear of being compromised by the enemy. Secure channels of communication are the key to protecting the identities and lives of our operatives.§!"
 upgrade_invisible_ink: "Hidden Listening Devices"

 upgrade_plastic_explosives: "Improvised Explosive Devices"
 upgrade_plastic_explosives_desc: "§WIEDs have become an indispensable weapon for non-state armed groups all over the world. Despite their simple construction, they are capable of massive destructive potential. As such, IEDs help to even the odds between disorganized groups of insurgents and professional militaries with armored vehicles. While the insurgents that we support overseas will undoubtedly be able to manufacture IEDs themselves, we can provide them with more sophisticated technology so as to maximize the destructiveness and reliability of their devices. In this way we, can strike a blow against our foreign enemies while maintaining plausible deniability.§!"
 upgrade_suicide_pills: "Suicide pills"
 upgrade_suicide_pills_desc: "§WWhile undesirable, it is inevitable that a handful of agents will be captured by our enemy.

 upgrade_training_centers: "Overseas Recruitment Centers"
 upgrade_training_centers_desc: "§WWhile our agents are able to adapt to any environment, the cultural norms and languages of foreign lands come more naturally to those born and raised in the culture.

 upgrade_commando_training: "Black Operations"
 upgrade_commando_training_desc: "§WSome of the tasks that our intelligence agency will be forced to perform require the utmost secrecy. These special activities demand the training of operatives, recruited from our country's special forces, who can perform paramilitary activities in dangerous conditions. It is not enough for these operatives to be willing to die for their country. They must also be willing to be abandoned by their country and publicly renounced should they fail in their mission.§!"
 upgrade_interrogation_techniques: "Interrogation Techniques"
 upgrade_interrogation_techniques_desc: "§WOften it can be more effective to break an enemy agent's mind rather than their body. The use of physical force is unreliable and often results in false information; a truly skilled interrogator is capable of breaking the enemy's will without violence. But, if it comes to that, we have ways of making them talk...§!"
 upgrade_diplo_training: "Diplomatic Training"

 upgrade_psycho_warfare_desc: "§WPropaganda has been an effective tool in securing our ideological interests within our own state, but no tool has been quite as effective as spreading fear of the enemy regimes and what they may bring to the country.

Cyber attacks can take a wide variety of forms, ranging from unsophisticated but effective direct denial-of-service attacks to the uploading of sophisticated malware programs.

 upgrade_decryption_boost_2_desc: "§WMachines have proven useful in encrypting data already, with machine-assisted encrypted signals proving the most difficult to decipher.
