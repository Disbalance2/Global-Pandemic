 internal_factions_events.7.t: "Work Contract Dispute"
 internal_factions_events.7.d: "Business owners are demanding that national work contracts could be loosened by local contracts between the employee and the employer. By allowing less restrictions on who can be fired and more liberties in allocated work hours, it would be easier for small businesses to hire staff. Most labour unions have already protested against this suggestion, saying that it's out of the question that the rights of the workers are reduced. In fact, they are suggesting more restrictions in work contracts to eliminate things such as paid internships."
 internal_factions_events.7.o1: "Local work contracts are favoured"
 internal_factions_events.7.o2: "The workers come first!"
 internal_factions_events.7.o3: "Maybe we can come to an understanding?"

 internal_factions_events.8.o2: "Who gives a hoot about religion anyways?"
 internal_factions_events.9.t: "Company Lists Itself on the Stock Market"

Advisors are suggesting to build additional SAM sites or build additional military industry to protect our state.

 ### Events for internal factions
 int_fac_deposed.1.t: "Small and Medium Business Owners Protest as Government Cuts Support"
 int_fac_deposed.1.d: "After several weeks of rollbacks, the [Root.GetAdjective] government today has announced more legislation to shrink several programs aiding small and medium business owners. \"The current political climate is hostile to people like us,\" spoke one affected by the recent changes who asked to remain anonymous. \"They don't care about the little man. They've forgotten that it's people like us that make a strong middle class.\" \n\nIn response to the backlash, [Root.GetLeader] claimed that accusations against the recent changes are \"overblown,\" and mentioned that [Root.GetAdjective] small businesses have continued to do well despite the changes. \"Make no mistake, this does not mark a shift in policy. I fully support our small businesses and understand their importance to hardworking [Root.GetAdjective] families struggling to put bread on the table. These recent changes are meant not to harm anyone, but reduce the amount of unnecessary government spending that has little economic impact.\" \n\nAngry over losing their influential position and direct influence over government policy, the Small Business Council has announced that local business owners are united in opposing the current government, and will be seeking to fund the opposition to the best of their abilities."
 int_fac_deposed.1.a: "Who shall fill their absence?"

 int_fac_deposed.2.t: "Bankers Fall from Grace in Dramatic Struggle for Power"
 int_fac_deposed.2.d: "In a stunning reversal of longstanding policy, the [Root.GetAdjective] government has officially announced the end of the \"Era of Big Banks.\" While surprising, the announcement was not completely unexpected. For several months, bankers and the financial sector at large had continued to find themselves at odds with the [Root.GetAdjective] political establishment. With the most recent announcement, however, a tipping point has been reached. \n\nReports are coming in that senior CEO's have been storming out in anger after several meetings with government ministers. One of the CEO's, speaking on a condition of anonymity, said that the government has \"lost its last touch with reality and is now entirely driven by populist demagoguery,\" adding that cooperation now is impossible. \n\nMeanwhile, [Root.GetLeader] boasted that \"we have broken the back of the corrupt leeches who have sucked the hard-earned money of the hard-working [Root.GetAdjective] people into their greedy hands.\"\n\nOpinion on the street is mixed. A recent survey concludes that 45% of the population is in support of the recent changes, 21% opposed, and 34% \"unsure\" of its effects. It's expected that the bankers and their international allies will work tirelessly to seek the downfall of the current government."
 int_fac_deposed.2.a: "Who shall fill their absence?"

 int_fac_deposed.3.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Government More Green as Fossil Fuel Gets the Door"
 int_fac_deposed.3.d: "Due to a dramatic shift in [Root.GetAdjective] government priorities, the once powerful fossil fuel industry now finds itself outside of the corridors of power. Long-awaited, the changes come as a fulfillment of promises made by [Root.GetLeader] to remove \"the stain that pollutes our way of life.\" \n\nThough environmentalists are praising this shift of policy, the industry itself has called this a \"colossal mistake of historical proportions.\" It is widely estimated that investments and output from the industry will decline. A recent report from the National Committee for Energy predicts that [Root.GetAdjective] energy extraction rates will reduce by 13%, and result in 40 billion in net losses. [Root.GetLeader] states that the report is \"flawed,\" and leaves out a growing renewable energy market that will gradually negate any potential losses caused by the merge. \n\nDespite this, industry leaders remain optimistic that they can affect change. \"We are working closely with lawmakers to bring about an pro-energy government\" spoke one affected CEO to our reporter."
 int_fac_deposed.3.a: "Who shall fill their absence?"

 int_fac_deposed.4.t: "Conglomerates Report Record Losses, [Root.GetLeader] Refuses Bailout"
 int_fac_deposed.4.d: "Today, the heads of several international manufacturers issued a public statement deriding [Root.GetLeader]'s government for refusing to bailout the industry, an act which they said \"threatened economic stability.\" \n\nIn an exclusive interview, the CFO of Octan stated that \"longstanding government disinterest in pro-market fiscal policy directly led to recent losses, and as a result corporations are suffering. I wouldn't be surprised about massive layoffs in the near future.\" \n\nIn response, [Root.GetLeader] claimed that \"it is not the responsibility of the taxpayer to cover the irresponsibility of corporations.\" And that, \"the [Root.GetAdjective] worker will not be blackmailed.\" \n\nThough small and independent businesses are praising this shift of policy, the conglomerates themselves have labeled this \"outrageously offensive,\" and an affront to the \"great values and tax revenue we bring to the table.\" \n\nThe Center for Economic Policy predicts that although the conglomerates will remain important for the overall economy, they will no longer be able to affect regulations to shut out competition. \"We will see most new growth coming from smaller businesses and startups,\" claimed the Center's head. \"This represents a new opportunity for economic revitalization.\" \n\nIf anything is certain, the industrial conglomerates are not happy. If no compromise is reached, relations between [Root.GetLeader]'s government and industry leaders will only continue to sour."
 int_fac_deposed.4.a: "I just hope the economy does well."

 int_fac_deposed.5.t: "Massive Government Crackdown on Oligarchs Consumes Nation"
 int_fac_deposed.5.d: "\"This is the beginning of a new era,\" spoke [Root.GetLeader] in a press conference held today in the capital. \"After decades of lax oversight and government corruption, we are finally ending the cancer that has been spreading within our great nation, and bringing power back into the hands of the many. Not the few.\" \n\nThis move comes after last Thursday's scandal involving several members of the unofficial alliance between the [Root.GetAdjective] government and business elites that has dominated this country's policies for years. Since Friday, several CEO's have found themselves convicted on multiple accounts of corruption, negligence, and bribery. \n\n\"The [Root.GetAdjective] people are finally free,\" spoke one citizen bolstered by the recent news. \"No longer will we have to fight our government as hard for change. Now they have to listen to us again.\" \n\n\"I'm crying,\" spoke a mother of two. \"We have finally taken back our country.\" \n\nOfficial estimates predict that the oligarchs have embezzled over 1.3 trillion dollars in national wealth over their time in power, and the number is only expected to grow as more documents revealing the extent of their corruption grows. \n\nAngry over losing their influential position and direct influence over government policy, the [Root.GetAdjective] oligarchs have stated their intentions in opposing the current government and will be seeking to fund the opposition in any way they can. \"Mark my words,\" spoke one oligarch on the condition of anonymity, \"you haven't seen the last of us.\""
 int_fac_deposed.5.a: "This is the end of the oligarchs."

 int_fac_deposed.6.t: "Fish Prices Rise as Maritime Industries Shrink Investments"
 int_fac_deposed.6.d: "After cutbacks and the end of government subsidies for the maritime industry, the average price of fish has increased 18% in the last two weeks alone. In an official statement released Tuesday, the [Root.GetAdjective] government announced that the money paid for bolstering maritime businesses will be redirected into new ventures and programs. \n\n\"The recent price increases will subside with time as new capital is invested in other areas of the [Root.GetAdjective] economy,\" the report reads. \"Current market fluctuations are expected to subside within two months, upon which new investments will drastically lower the price of goods once more. In the meantime, we will be monitoring the situation to ensure that no hard-working family is left hungry. We want this transition to be as smooth as possible.\" \n\nSeveral business owners, however, aren't so sure. \"We may see the price of fish go down in a few months, but what about the price of replacement ship parts? Or netting? There's so much more to this equation than fish that the government is missing.\" \n\nThe [Root.GetAdjective] fishing, aquaculture, and shipbuilding industries have since announced their decision in amending the recent changes and will be seeking to fund opposition to the measures in any way they can."
 int_fac_deposed.6.a: "I never liked fish anyway."

 int_fac_deposed.7.t: "Defense Contractors Claim Military is \"Unprepared\" for Major Conflict"
 int_fac_deposed.7.d: "Defense contractors for the [Root.GetAdjective] government today have claimed that the military will be unprepared to face \"sophisticated, modern threats to national security\" due to recent cutbacks in military spending. According to a letter signed by six of the largest arms manufacturers, this move will be \"disastrous\" to the [Root.GetAdjective] economy and weaken its position on the global stage. \n\nThe letter comes after the fiscal budget for the coming year was announced on Wednesday. The document featured significant cuts to defense spending and a large reduction in government contracts which have become the norm these last few years. \n\n\"Everyone is shocked,\" states the letter. \"while we disapprove of this weakening of the [Root.GetAdjective] military, we respect the wishes of the [Root.GetAdjective] government and hope that there will be increased cooperation between us in the near future.\" \n\nIt is expected that the contracts that remain will be even more highly prized than they are today."
 int_fac_deposed.7.a: "Our military is still strong."

 int_fac_deposed.8.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Military Falls from Political Power"
 int_fac_deposed.8.d: "In a shocking move by [Root.GetLeader], the [Root.GetAdjective] Armed Forces have been shut out from directly influencing the running of the government through a new measure passed into law today. The move, taken by [Root.GetLeader] to reportedly \"remove corruption and increase transparency\" is being hailed by the UN as a \"move towards greater rights for [Root.GetAdjective] citizens.\" Citizens celebrated in the nation's capital, and are largely supportive of the move. \n\nWhile no reports of violence have emerged, fears are rising that several high-ranking officers will not back down silently. Several generals are reportedly furious, but declined to comment on whether they would do anything other than voice their frustration. \n\nAn independent analyst offered that \"though removing the military from power and keeping the government civilian is a strength for the rule of law, there is always the danger of a military coup when these types of things happen.\""
 int_fac_deposed.8.a: "We will watch this situation with great interest."

 int_fac_deposed.9.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Intelligence Communities Loose Political Support"
 int_fac_deposed.9.d: "After several weeks of back-and-forth comments made by [Root.GetLeader], today it was announced that the [Root.GetAdjective] intelligence community would see large cuts to its budget starting in the next fiscal year. The move is to reportedly consolidate the many intelligence agencies currently spread across the various branches of the military, and to further \"streamline and centralize\" the decision-making process. \n\n[Root.GetLeader] has tasked the heads of the agencies affected to draft a plan to transfer personnel and equipment during the transition period. According to the pro-intelligence group known as the National Center for Security, \"recent moves by [Root.GetAdjective] government indicate it is not taking the threat of international terrorism seriously,\" and that the cuts will \"affect the ability to keep the [Root.GetAdjective] people safe.\" \n\nWhile the positive and negative implications of the move are still being debated, it remains to be seen how this will affect the political scene, as the [Root.GetAdjective] intelligence community has previously enjoyed the full support of the government for a very long time."
 int_fac_deposed.9.a: "Who will watch the watchmen?"

 int_fac_deposed.10.t: "Labor Unions Face Challenges as Government Favors Business"
 int_fac_deposed.10.d: "\"Today is a defeat for labor. Today is a defeat for democracy.\" At least, that is according to the head of the largest union in the country, whose membership spans in the hundreds of thousands. The call for action today comes after [Root.GetLeader] announced new legislation today limiting the collective bargaining power of the unions. The move is labeled a \"cornerstone\" for future economic growth by the current government. \n\n\"We will see record growth,\" spoke the chairman of the economics committee. \"With this new legislation, we will simplify existing regulations and allow our businesses to compete globally without being afraid of making the tough decisions required in a competitive marketplace.\" The chairman's comment comes after last month's highly publicized case involving a mother of two children who claimed she had been fired on the basis of her pregnancy. While the unions demanded that her job be returned,  unclear language regarding \"small businesses\" and their accountability started a lengthy court case. \n\n\"We are not discriminating against the worker. But for small businesses that need every available worker to simply make ends meet, sometimes, tough decisions must be made,\" spoke the chairman. \n\n\"This is a slippery slope,\" the head of the union replied in a public hearing. \"We have already seen how [Root.GetLeader] favors big businesses at the expense of the [Root.GetAdjective] worker. Even before today, [Root.GetLeader] has made his disdain for our cause clear.\" \n\nAn independent analyst from the Center on Economic Policy stated that, \"we are seeing a new era for the [Root.GetAdjective] worker. These changes have been nothing but consistent with current government policies and attitudes regarding the role of labor unions. I would expect further measures passed that will limit their power over the coming months.\" \n\nThe unions, however, aren't giving up without a fight. \"We're fighting until the end,\" spoke one member. \"They can't take our rights from us.\""
 int_fac_deposed.10.a: "I just hope the economy does well."

 int_fac_deposed.11.t: "Parades in Capital after [Root.GetAdjective] Elites Relinquish Land"
 int_fac_deposed.11.d: "Celebrations broke out today in the [Root.GetAdjective] capital after twenty wealthy landowners announced their resignations from senior positions in the [Root.GetAdjective] government. The move comes as the latest attempts of [Root.GetLeader] to reduce the power of the landowners within the country, who have controlled the majority of the country's arable farmland for generations. \n\n\"We are so happy now, we the people will have more say in our government,\" spoke one farmer overjoyed by the change. \"I'm just glad they resigned so peacefully. You never know when people will act out violently in situations like this.\" \n\nIndeed, the situation has remained peaceful, although the police have been ordered on high alert for the foreseeable future. While people celebrate, analysts are curious as to why several landowners suddenly resigned on the same day. \"This definitely seems suspicious,\" spoke one expert. \"But as long as no one gets hurt, things may turn out better for everyone in the end.\" Others are not so sure, and suspect that we may not have seen the last of the landowners."
 int_fac_deposed.11.a: "Who shall fill their absence?"

 int_fac_deposed.12.t: "Riots Break out as Government Refuses Aid to Hungry Farmers"
 int_fac_deposed.12.d: "Protests erupted today after the [Root.GetAdjective] government refused support for farmers affected by yet another bad harvest. The government has stationed troops in the capital as thousands of hungry citizens flock to the cities to demand action. \n\n\"We want change!\", the farmers scream in the streets. Witnesses report that rubber bullets and tear gas have been used to clear protesters out of certain sections of the city, and reports are coming in of looting in the financial district. \n\n\"We are a nation of laws,\" spoke the [Root.GetAdjective] leader [Root.GetLeader]. \"These violent demonstrations must end immediately. Order will be restored.\" \n\nInternational observers in the UN conclude that unless the situation stabilizes, further regional instability may jeopardize the fragile balance of peace in the region, and fuel the rise of possible extremist groups."

 int_fac_deposed.13.t: "Communist Cadres Lose Out in Political Purge"
 int_fac_deposed.13.d: "\"A new day has dawned. Corruption and vice will no longer plague us. Victory is at hand.\" Those were the words spoken by [Root.GetAdjective] leader [Root.GetLeader] today in a televised address to the nation. The speech comes after continuing shake ups within the Communist Party have ousted several leading members from power and installed new leadership in key positions within the bureaucracy. \n\nIndependent analysts believe that the move comes at the behest of several leading members within the Party leadership to modernize the country's political system into a more efficient and stable form. \n\nOpinions on the street are mixed. A new survey finds that only 31% approve of the reforms, with 27% opposed and 42% unsure of what the changes will mean. \n\nOthers are more optimistic. \"This move presents a great opportunity for the [Root.GetAdjective] government to reinvent itself,\" spoke an observer at the UN. \"This is the first time in recent history that something of this magnitude has occurred. It would be a shame if nothing meaningful came of these changes in the long term.\""

 int_fac_deposed.14.t: "Secularization Begins. Government Reduces Power of Religious Authority in Bold New Move."
 int_fac_deposed.14.d: "A major change is happening to the way the [Root.GetAdjective] government will handle its legal system. \n\nUntil now, legal code was based on interpretation of religious texts and imposed into the justice system. Not anymore. In a bold and stunning move, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetAdjective] law will no longer be \"largely reliant\" on interpretations of religious dogma. The move comes after student demonstrations reached a third week inside capital. \n\n\"This change is good, but it is not enough,\" spoke one demonstrator to our reporter. \"The [Root.GetAdjective] government needs to do a lot more to improve the lives of those who may not be a member of the prevailing religious order. Minorities still need more representation.\" However the protester, speaking on a condition of anonymity, did state that he was \"overjoyed\" to hear of the recent changes, and believed they represented a positive step forwards for the nation. \n\nReligious leaders have a different opinion on the matter. \"The people will want to come back to the old ways,\" spoke one shortly after the announcement took place. \"They will see how much better things were when the faithful judged the faithless. We will see a deterioration in moral values. I ask the people to remain calm in this temporary period of uncertainty.\" It is expected that religious authorities will oppose the new government until a compromise is reached, however unlikely that seems."

 int_fac_deposed.15.t: "The Royal Families Lose Influence in New [Root.GetAdjective] Government"
 int_fac_deposed.15.d: "Shifts in power among the [Root.GetAdjective] leadership have resulted in deep rifts between the royal family and [Root.GetLeader]. For what seems like an eternity, the royal family has been able to maintain control over the government and its political affairs. Sons and daughters were promoted into office due to connections and influence, and the self-styled nobility enjoyed enormous latitude over the implementation of both foreign and domestic policy. According to [Root.GetLeader], these days are over. \n\n\"For far too long, the extended families and moneyed ties of the elite have created a government where positions and titles are earned through connections and status, not hard-work and determination,\" spoke [Root.GetLeader] today. The moves come after several posts on social media derided the current government for being lazy and negligent, and demanded political action to affect change. It would appear that [Root.GetLeader] has listened. \n\nThe international community has announced its full support behind the recent developments. They claim that a system of governance based on a meritocracy shall bring greater prosperity and equality to the [Root.GetAdjective] people. However, the royal family has made its displeasure clear. \n\n\"[Root.GetLeader] doesn't know what he is talking about,\" spoke the former finance head. \"You haven't seen the last of us.\""

 int_fac_deposed.16.t: "Presence of the Iranian Quds Force Limited in Dramatic Move"
 int_fac_deposed.16.d: "Reports are coming in that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is reducing the size of its mission within the [Root.GetAdjective] government. The Iranian Quds force, longtime friend to [Root.GetLeader], has not confirmed or denied these reports, however it is expected that [Root.GetLeader] himself will make an announcement about the change in the coming days. \n\nFor years now, the Iranian Quds Force has been advising and training top military officials, and providing the [Root.GetAdjective] government with key intelligence and tactical information. In an older interview, the former Chief of the Army stated that \"the Quds inform an important part of our military strategy\" and that \"many of our military victories relied on the great operational advantage provide by the IRGC.\" \n\nReaction on the street is mixed, with 67% of the population unsure of how the recent changes will affect them. Only 12% are in support of the recent reduction in IRGC presence, while the remaining 21% are opposed."

 int_fac_deposed.17.t: "Foreign Jihadis Relegated As Conflict Winds Down"
 int_fac_deposed.17.d: "\"The time for Jihad has ended. The foreign soldiers of Allah may return to their homes.\" Spoke the self-styled Islamic messiah [Root.GetLeader] in front of a crowd of their loyal followers today. \"We have spilt much blood in the name of Allah, and our unholy enemies have been slain in the millions by our vengeful spirits. The sacred lands are secure. Now it is time to rebuild our civilization and steel our faith.\" \n\nWith these words, the conflict that has raged across the region appears to be finally winding down. Experts are surprised by the sudden nature of this announcement, however most are in agreement that its coming was foreshadowed for months ahead of time. According to Bjornstad Hansen of the United Nations, the recent drawdown of forces is based on two factors. \"Firstly, the suddenness of this announcements speaks to the belief of [Root.GetLeader] that the conflict has already been won. This type of behavior is common in terror cells where the benefits of using foreign soldiers is outweighed by the problems they bring with them.\" This, Hansen concludes, likely forms a second reason for the announcement. \"Foreign soldiers bring foreign ideals, customs, and culture. Their motives often clash with local forces, and the language barrier is often an issue.\" \n\nWhatever the case for the announcement, the withdrawal of foreign Jihadis shall hopefully bring greater peace to the war-torn region."

 int_fac_deposed.18.t: "Revolutionary Guards Dissolved, to be Absorbed by Armed Forces"
 int_fac_deposed.18.d: "\"The Republic is under attack!\" Spoke the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in a press conference today. \"The actions of [Root.GetLeader] speak to a weakening of his religious convictions and confirm his power-hungry grab for influence over our great nation.\" \n\nFounded after the 1979 Revolution, the IRGC has served as Iran's first line of defense against counter-movements aimed against its Islamic republic system. Its expansion in 2009 under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration has led many Western scholars to believe that its size and influence has even surpassed the Shia clerical system. Its role in spreading Iranian influence across the Middle East has put it at the forefront of military operations that have spread across the region since the dawn of the 21st century. \n\n[Root.GetLeader], speaking to a crowd gathered in Tehran, spoke of the recent shakeups. \"This move comes as a way to reduce the power that the Guards have amassed over our country. The Islamic Republic only had one threat, and that was the threat posed by the IRGC.\" The Supreme Leader has approved of these recent actions, and also announced his support of the measures. \n\nWestern scholars are dumbfounded at the announcement. With the influence the IRGC previously had within Iranian society, it was a \"huge surprise\" as the UN secretary general put it, that these changes could even be discussed, much less acted upon. \n\n\"Today is a new day for Iran\", spoke [Root.GetLeader]. \"Allah guide me.\""
