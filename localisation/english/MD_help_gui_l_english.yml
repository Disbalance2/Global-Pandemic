 HELP_BUTTON_TT: "Click this button open up the help windows for this tab. Click this button again to close all windows"
 HELP_BUTTON_TT_delayed: "The help windows will explain mechanics of Millennium Dawn. You can find this button on various tabs in the game"
 HELP_BUTTON_PARTIES_TT: "Your political parties are divided into 5 separate §HOutlooks§!; Western, Emerging, Salafist, Non-Aligned and Nationalist. Each §HOutlook§! is divided into §HParties§!. By clicking the two green arrows, you will be able to see all the parties of your country and descriptions for what each Outlook and party represents. In this window, you can boost and attack parties. A party's maximum popularity is limited by the Outlook's popularity that it belongs to. After elections, the §HParty§! with the highest popularity wins"
 HELP_BUTTON_PARTIES_TT_delayed: "On elections:\nAfter elections, the party that wins the elections has to form a coalition with other parties to reach a majority in the parliament. If this can't be done, you will receive a §HPolitical Power§! penalty. The ruling party will be chosen between the two largest parties, and the two largest parties can't form a coalition together. Coalition forming is done in the §HDecisions Tab§!, and you will only have limited time to form it"
 HELP_BUTTON_GDP_TT: "Your §HGDP per Capita§! describes the overall wealth level of the nation. Richer countries have slower population and economic growth, but enjoy from faster research and lower interest rates on their debt. You can increase your GDP/capita by filling all your building slots in all your owned states"
 HELP_BUTTON_GDP_TT_delayed: "Note! If your country has more than 78 factories, you can leave one empty slot in each state and still be able to upgrade your GDP/capita"
 HELP_BUTTON_TAXES_TT: "The main income for your country are §HTaxes§!. By increasing your taxes, you will be able to make more money, but part of your available §HCivilian Industries§! will be used up as §HTax Cost§! depending on your §HTax Rate§!. This means your ability to construct buildings (and hence your economic growth) will be slowed down. Reducing your taxes will have the opposite effect. You can adjust your tax rate with the '+' and '-' buttons"
 HELP_BUTTON_FINANCES_TT: "It is important to manage your government's income and expenditure. On the top bar, you will see your §HDebt§!, §HTreasury§! and §HInternational Investments§!.\n\n§HDebt§! describes how much money your country has borrowed. You have to pay interest on your loan. Your interest rates are determined by your debt-to-GDP ratio. A high interest rate (>15%) can lead to bankruptcy!\n\n§HTreasury§! describes how much money your country currently has. By hovering over the treasury, you will see whether you are making a weekly profit or deficit. If you have no treasury and you are running a deficit, your debt will be automatically increased.\n\n§HInternational Investments§! describe how much money your country has invested abroad. You get a flat return rate of your investments, which is added to your weekly income. You can invest in other countries by clicking on a state not owned by you, and choosing from the build menu above the state window.\n\nIncreasing your spending levels will give you various bonuses but will cost you more money"
 HELP_BUTTON_FINANCES_TT_delayed: "Note! In Millennium Dawn, the economy is modelled after real life. Just like in real life, it is normal to run a deficit and fund some of your spending through debt. Just keep your interest rate in check by expanding your economy and increasing your GDP per capita!"
 HELP_BUTTON_INTERNAL_FACTIONS_TT: "Internal Factions represent powerful groups that hold political power in your country. If they like you, they will give you bonuses. Factions disliking you has the opposite effect. Internal factions may demand things of you, and limit your options in regards to politics and national focuses. The opinion of internal factions can change through focuses, decisions and events"
 HELP_BUTTON_TRADE_TT: "The level of your trade law determines how much of your natural resources are exported to the market. When you export resources, you will gain extra income. You will gain income regardless of whether or not another country buys your resources"
 HELP_BUTTON_DECISIONS_TT: "Millennium Dawn uses decisions to a much greater extent for content than the base game. Remember to periodically check your available decisions for new decisions. You can untick decisions that are of no interest to you, and any new decisions that appear will automatically trigger the '§HDecisions Available§!' notification"
 HELP_BUTTON_RESEARCH_TT: "In Millennium Dawn, countries start with equipment that they have developed themselves in the real world, and any base equipment they need for their starting templates. As a minor, you have to rely on larger countries to get the most modern equipment. If you want to be self-sufficient, you have to invest considerable resources to develop domestic weapons systems"
 HELP_BUTTON_SLOTS_TT: "In Millennium Dawn, research slots are very limited and you have to prioritise what to keep up-to date. More research slots can be acquired through national focuses"
 HELP_BUTTON_INFLUENCE_TT: "Each country is affected by the §HInfluence§! of foreign countries. Influence represents the soft power and control countries have over each other. Countries will naturally drift towards the same §HOutlook§! as their influencers. The more influence another country has, the stronger the drift. By spending influence, countries can affect the politics of other countries, gain resources and even puppet other countries. Influence is gained by spending §HPolitical Power§! or by investing in other countries. You can fight against influence through a decision in the decisions tab"
 HELP_BUTTON_RESOURCES_TT: "Unlike in the base game, in Millennium Dawn all military equipment costs oil to produce. This is to incentivise countries to buy oil even during peace time, and make them dependent on oil producing countries"
 HELP_BUTTON_TEMPLATES_TT: "The units differ quite a lot from the base game. In rough terms, units become stronger as they become heavier (Light Infantry -> Infantry -> Mechanized Infantry -> Armoured Infantry -> Armoured), but as a downside they cost more and suffer more terrain penalties.\n\nThe base combat width has been increased from 60 to 120 when compared to the base game, and individual battalion widths are often uneven numbers. This is to reduce the importance of having the optimum combat width for your templates. In most cases, you will not be able to fill the available combat width to its maximum. In terms of unit size, larger units are always better"
 HELP_BUTTON_EQUIPMENT_TT: "In Millennium Dawn, all your starting units start without any equipment. All starting equipment is instead put into the starting stockpiles of countries. This is done in order to have all countries start with their correct historical real life equipment. For this reason, it is a good idea not to immediately start training new units, as you'll 'steal' equipment from your already existing units. It takes roughly a week of in-game time to fill up your starting units"
