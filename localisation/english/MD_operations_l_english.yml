A combination of incorrect intelligence and ineptitude has led to the deaths of several civilians who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. This mistake will inevitably lead to greater sympathy for the jihadist cause among the local population, but its domestic fallout could be mitigated by denying involvement."
