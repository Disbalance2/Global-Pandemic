 ##Leader Descriptions
 GOH_CHOK_TONG_DESC: "Goh Chok Tong was first elected Prime Minister in 1990, winning with a comfortable majority. Tong's ascension to PM and his early years as PM are littered with abnormalities. Goh became Prime Minister after Lee Kuan Yew stepped down in later 1990. Goh proceeded to call a snap election then. It was a landslide for the PAP and allowed Goh to usher in a new mandate.\n\nAlthough, he is not as notable as his predecessor Lee Kuan Yew. Goh made strides with his policies that supported 'little bohemias' within the city."
