 comor.15.t: "Politics in Comoros"
 comor.15.d: "The year 2000 was a tumultuous time for the Comoros, a small nation located off the coast of Africa. The country was ruled by a coalition government, made up of representatives from the three main islands: Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli. However, tensions were high between the islands, with each vying for more power and resources. This led to frequent political instability and coups, as politicians attempted to gain control of the government. In January 2000, a military coup led by Colonel Azali Assoumani overthrew President Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde. Assoumani promised to restore stability to the country and hold free and fair elections. Now only time will show what Comoro's future will be."
