 night_vision_1_desc: "First-generation passive devices, introduced during the Vietnam War, were an adaptation of earlier active GEN 0 technology, and rely on ambient light instead of an infrared light source. Using an S-20 photocathode, their image intensifiers produce a light amplification of around 1,000x, but are quite bulky and require moonlight to function properly."
 night_vision_2_desc: "Second-generation devices feature an improved image intensifier tube utilizing microchannel plate (MCP) with an S-25 photocathode, resulting in a much brighter image, especially around the edges of the lens. This leads to increased illumination in low ambient light environments, such as moonless nights. Light amplification is around 20,000x. Also improved were image resolution and reliability."
 night_vision_3_desc: "Third-generation night vision systems maintain the MCP from Gen II, but now use a photocathode made with gallium arsenide, which further improves image resolution. In addition, the MCP is coated with an ion barrier film for increased tube life."
 night_vision_4_desc: "An automatic-gated power supply system regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions. The second upgrade is a removed or greatly thinned ion barrier, which decreases the number of electrons that are usually rejected by the Standard GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less image noise and the ability to operate with a luminous sensitivity at 2,850 K."

MBTs are heavily armored and highly mobile in flat terrain, and provide armies with powerful direct fire abilities."

 MBT_7: "MBT 2025"
 MBT_7_desc: "The incorporation of nanotubes into the composite armor mix improves protection, and enables important weight reductions. Automation of all the Main Battle Tank's systems makes a operator optional, allowing for changed shape-profiles to reduce Radar Cross-Sections, which together with radio-wave absorbent materials and a powerful exhaust cooling system give the tank semi-stealth characteristics. MBTs are heavily armored and highly mobile in flat terrain, and provide armies with powerful direct fire abilities."

 ENG_IFV_3_desc: "The first true IFV designed and built by the British, the Warrior IFV was initially designed to replace the aging fleet of FV430s in the British Army after realising the need to increase protection and firepower for the current arsenal of combat vehicles. Adequately armed with a 30mm gun and ATGM launcher, the Warrior IFV was to become the rival against the vaunted BMP series of the Soviet Army. The Warrior soon proved itself to be battle-worthy in the Bosnian conflict in the 1990s."

It has greatly improved armour, optics and firepower, making the Chieftain one of the best options against the Soviet adversaries. However, the one flaw that held the Chieftain back was its terrible engine - born with the noble idea to power up the tank with any kind of oil in the case of war, the engine turned out to be extremely unreliable and slow."

 ENG_MBT_3_desc: "Originally an MBT-80 project, the tank was designed based on the Chieftain tank for Iranian needs, but with the Islamic Revolution in Iran the project was cancelled. The British Army became the client, and thus tank was modified to suit the British needs. The Challenger I became the first tank to use the revolutionary Chobham armour, granting superior protection over any western RHA of that time. It became one of the pre-eminent tanks at the end of the 20th Century."

Developed for the Italian Armed Forces as part of the Soldato Futuro (English: \"Future Soldier\") program, the ARX160 was launched in 2008 as a commercial weapon system independent from the Soldato Futuro ensemble, complete with a companion single-shot 40x46mm NATO low-velocity grenade launcher, called the GLX160, which can be mounted underneath the rifle or used with an ad hoc stock system as a stand-alone weapon."
 ITA_infantry_weapons5: "ARX160A3"
 ITA_infantry_weapons5_desc: "The Beretta ARX160 A3 is an improved variant of the ARX160 which features some design changes. The changes include a redesigned handguard, where its top row air vent slits have been replaced with larger square cut outs, though the bottom row air vent still retains the thinner slits. These larger cut outs reduce some weight of the rifle while letting more air circulate around the barrel."

 ### Singapore ###
 SIN_infantry_weapons: "M16S1"
 SIN_infantry_weapons_desc: "The M16S1 is an export variant of the US M16A1 rifle that was licensed to ST Kinetics for local production. In the early days of the SAF, the M16S1 was the standard issue weapon for every soldier. Despite some modifications made to the M16A1 for local uses, the M16S1 still showed some of its early shortcomings, prompting Singapore's defence industry to look for better designs. The M16S1 is still stored and used as reserve weapons as of today."
 SIN_infantry_weapons1: "SAR 80"
 SIN_infantry_weapons2: "SR 88"
 SIN_infantry_weapons3: "SAR 21"
 SIN_infantry_weapons3_desc: "The first successful indigenous assault rifle designed and produced locally by ST Kinetics, the SAR 21 is the contemporary solution for the SAF's needs in the 21st Century. Despite looking similar to the Steyr AUG, its mechanisms are based off the AR-15 models modified and improved for the SAF needs. Replacing the obsolete M16S1, the SAR 21 now serves as the current mainstay weapon for every soldier, personnel and reservist in the SAF."
 SIN_infantry_weapons4: "SAR 21 MMS"
 SIN_infantry_weapons4_desc: "In the early 2000s the Ministry of Defence had unveiled a new framework for a technologically advanced fighting force, launching the initiative to transform the SAF into a 3rd Generation Army. The SAR 21 MMS is a modified variant of the SAR 21 that comes under the Advanced Combat Man System. It is introduced in 2005 to give every serviceman the situational awareness they need in the modern battlefield, fully integrated with HUD displays, tactical data-links and an advanced network of communications as part of the SAF's transition into a 3G Fighting Force."
 SIN_infantry_weapons5: "BR 18 BMCR"
 SIN_infantry_weapons5_desc: "The BMCR was first revealed in the 2014 Singapore Air Show as part of the SAF's future technology. It soon became the BR-18 Assault Rifle that will be replacing the SAR 21, quickly entering production in 2018."

 SIN_APC_1: "M113A1"
 SIN_APC_1_short: "M113"
 SIN_APC_1_desc: "When independence was violently thrust into Singapore, the fledgling SAF needed to build up to modern standards from scratch. The first thing they needed was a functioning vehicle platform for mechanisation of their infantries, and what other better options were there than the excessively abundant amounts of M113s sitting in the US military depots?"
 SIN_APC_2: "M113A2 Ultra"
 SIN_APC_2_short: "M113 Ultra"
 SIN_APC_2_desc: "Initially, the fleet of M113s were upgraded into an A2 variant. However, in the early 80s the M113A2s were modified by ST Engineering to fit the locally designed 40mm Grenade Launchers and .50 Cal HMGs. Dubbed as the M113A2 Ultra, they were further improved with the Rafael Weapon Stations and a 25mm Bushmaster gun."
 SIN_APC_3: "Bandvagn 206"
 SIN_APC_3_short: "Bv 206"
 SIN_APC_3_desc: "When studying the geopolitical landscape of the nation's potential battlefields, one of the key concerns was the mechanised forces' ability to traverse through difficult terrains. In the 1970s, not many wheeled carriers would fit the requirements of the SAF with the exception of the Swedish Bandvagn 206. Hence, the SAF acquired several Bv 206s to augment some of its motorised infantries for a brief period of time. Eventually, they were replaced by the locally designed Bronco ATTCs, with the Bv 206s being used by the nation's firefighting force instead."
 SIN_APC_4: "Bronco ATTC"
 SIN_APC_4_short: "Bronco ATTC"
 SIN_APC_4_desc: "The Bronco development came about after the SAF reviewed that the Bv 206 was not designed to fight a war that Singapore might face. Inspired by the massive utility of the American humvees, and driven by the need to traverse through difficult, swampy terrains, ST Engineering designed and made the Bronco ATTC similar to the Swedish Bandvagn. The ability to swim across the straits, roll through forested or swampy areas and its relatively large interior has made the Bronco a much-needed APC for the SAF's infantry forces."
 SIN_APC_5: "Terrex AV-81"
 SIN_APC_5_short: "Terrex"
 SIN_APC_5_desc: "The Terrex ICV was first conceived to be necessary by the government when the 21st Century came about, firmly believing that a new generation of APC is needed for the SAF to replace the aging M113s and the inadequate Bronco ATTCs. In line with SAF's transition into a 3G Army, the Terrex ICV was designed and developed by ST Engineering. Equipped with a brand new modular armour and the essential Battlefield Management System module, the Terrex now serves as a mainstay to the SAF's motorised infantries."
 SIN_APC_6: "Terrex AV-81 III"
 SIN_APC_6_short: "Terrex 3"
 SIN_APC_6_desc: "Recently developed from the original Terrex, the Terrex 3 has improved armour, amphibious capabilities and is able to mount a 30mm automated gun turret. Though not requested by the SAF, the Terrex 3 is being used by the Australian Army."

 SIN_IFV_4: "Bionix 25"
 SIN_IFV_4_short: "Bionix 25"
 SIN_IFV_4_desc: "In the mid 1980s, the government realized that sustaining the fleet of outdated M113s and AMX-13s was not going to work if they wanted their neighbours to not treat the SAF like a joke. Hence, the MINDEF acquisition house was appointed to study several foreign designs - the FV510 Warrior, the M2 Bradley and the Marder IFV. In the end, all of them failed to meet the stringent needs of the SAF, so the local industry decided to design and make their own IFV from scratch. The Bionix 25 finally came about in 1997 and was immediately assigned to the SAF's fledging armoured brigades."
 SIN_IFV_5: "Bionix II"
 SIN_IFV_5_short: "Bionix II"
 SIN_IFV_5_desc: "Despite the success of the Bionix 25, the SAF found it slightly inadequate in the changing climate at the beginning of the 21st Century. The Bionix design was then reevaluated before a new upgrade package came along. In tandem with SAF's transition into a 3G Fighting Force, the Bionix II was given the Bushmaster II gun, upgrades to the MEXAS armour, and the brand new Battlefield Management System. This single upgrade has given a massive edge to the SAF's armoured brigades in tactical situational awareness, effectively increasing the efficiency of SAF's armoured forces."
 SIN_IFV_6: "Hunter AFV"
 SIN_IFV_6_short: "Hunter"
 SIN_IFV_6_desc: "Originally unveiled as the NGAFV in 2016, the Hunter AFV is SAF's most recently commissioned weapon, featuring an unmanned Rafael 30mm gun, ATGM launcher and ARTEMIS battlefield support system. The Hunter is showcased as a (political) symbol of Singapore's military prowess in the recent National Day Parade in light of the territorial disputes between Singapore and Malaysia in late 2018."

 SIN_MBT_2: "Centurion Tempest"
 SIN_MBT_2_desc: "Desperate to find a replacement for the aging AMX-13 tanks, the SAF chose to seek for foreign exports to supplement its armoured fleet. The UK refused to export some of its retiring Centurions to Singapore, so the SAF decided to buy the tanks from India instead. In the 1990s, the SAF acquired more Centurions from Israel, and with the help of Israeli assistance, the SAF fleet of Centurions was upgraded to the Tempest with the IDF's modern standards. The Centurion Tempests remained in service up till the 2000s when the German Leopards finally became an option."
 SIN_MBT_1: "AMX-13 SM1"
 SIN_MBT_1_desc: "The first tanks that rolled through the Padang Parade Square in the first anniversaries of Singapore's independence were 2 newly formed platoons of AMX-13s. Later modified by ST Kinetics into the SM1 variants, the AMX-13s were the pride of the SAF from the early 1960s up until 2000. Despite its various shortcomings as an obsolete light tank, the AMX-13s had been the spear of the Singapore Army."
 SIN_MBT_4: "Leopard 2A4"
 SIN_MBT_4_desc: "The sudden dissolution of the USSR had left the recently reunified Germans thinking on their abundant supplies of Leopard 2A4s. When they finally had the brilliant idea of selling all of the extra Leopards to foreign countries, Singapore was amongst the first to strike a deal with Germany on the acquisition of the Leopard tanks. First delivered in 2005, the SAF quickly replaced the AMX-13s and swiftly began building up a modern armoured brigade."
 SIN_MBT_5: "Leopard 2SG"
 SIN_MBT_5_desc: "The Leopard 2SG is a variant modified by ST Kinetics with Rheinmetall's Evolution package. Equipped with AMAP modular armour, the Leopard 2SG is designed to fight better in urban areas. The better-armoured tanks now augment the fleet of Leopard 2A4s, serving alongside the Bionixes and the Terrexes as they become the new spear of the Singapore Army."
 SIN_MBT_7: "Leokava SG AMBT"

 SIN_SP_arty_2: "SSPH Primus"
 SIN_SP_arty_2_desc: "At first it was the M109, then it was the AS-90, then it was the Akatsiya. When all foreign designs failed to fulfill all of Singapore's needs, the local industry decided to just design and produce one themselves. The SSPH Primus was created as a result. It functions very similar to the M109A6 Paladin but shares some of its systems with the locally designed Bionix IFV."
 SIN_SP_arty_3: "Advanced Mobile Gun System"
 SIN_SP_arty_3_short: "AMGS 155mm"
 SIN_SP_R_arty_2: "M142 HIMARS"
 SIN_SP_R_arty_2_desc: "To further enhance the capabilities of the SAF's forward defence strategy, the proposal to acquire a sophisticated MLRS came about in 2007. However, the M270 is too expensive and heavy, and most MLRS were not integrated with the latest datalink technologies. However, the M142 HIMARS meets the SAF's requirements of being affordable and a highly advanced platform, hence they sought the US for acquisition. In 2011, the SAF commissioned its first HIMARS battery and it became the first fully guided GPS-guided HIMARS units."

Originally derived from the South African Marauder MRAP, the Belrex is designed to serve a similar role but with the flexibility to be modified for different missions and needs. The Belrex was to replace SAF's 5-ton trucks and armoured vehicles."

Much like the older AKM the 103 can use a variety of sights, including night vision and telescopic. As well as fit a bayonet or grenade launcher. The difference from most AKs is the 103's plastic and cheaper materials."
 SOV_infantry_weapons4: "AK-12"
 SOV_infantry_weapons4_desc: "The AK-12 is a new Russian assault rifle. It was developed under the Ratnik future infantrymen programme.

 JAP_Int_Fighter1_desc: "In 1975, the Japanese Defence Agency evaluated the inventory of the JASDF and concluded that there was a need to replace the aging fleet of F-104Js. They examined a list of contemporary aircraft from foreign countries, and eventually the competition narrowed down to two aircraft - the F-14 Tomcat and the F-15 Eagle. Though the F-15 triumphed over the F-14, many Japanese at that time believed that the F-14 would be adopted together with the F-15 into the JASDF. Dubbed as the F-14J, this is the interceptor that the JASDF would consider to acquire and modify if the need arises."
