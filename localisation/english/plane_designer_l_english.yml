 ENGINE_INFO: "\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Engines provide different advantages based on the number chosen. For small and medium aircraft, dual engines will provide increased speed, thrust, and reliability, while also requiring more IC to build.§!\n\n§BFor Quad, Six, and Eight engine aircraft, more engines will provide increased thrust and reliability, while reducing speed and increasing build cost.§!\n\n§RPropeller engines will usually be cheaper than their jet engine counterparts and will consume less fuel and supply, and will have less speed, but slightly increased thrust by comparison.§!"
