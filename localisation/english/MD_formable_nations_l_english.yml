 form_WESTFED_category: "West Indies Federation"
 form_WESTFED_category_desc: "The West Indies Federation was a short-lived political union from 1958 to 1962 that included many Caribbean island nations. The union quickly fell apart due to disputes over how it would be governed or function viably. The idea still holds some value amongst the nations, and it could very well be the next great nation in the Western Hemisphere. Are we going to lead the Caribbean into this new tomorrow?"

 form_AUSHUN_category_desc: "The Austro-Hungarian Empire was a great power in Central Europe in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The nation was dissolved after its resounding defeat in the Great War. It broke apart into the nations of Czechia, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bosnia, and portions of Ukraine, Poland, and Romania. It is time to reclaim the mantle that was lost so long ago. It is time to reform the Austro-Hungarian Empire."

 #Peru-Bolivian Confederation
 form_PBL_category: "Peru-Bolivian Confederation"
 form_PBL_category_desc: "The Peru-Bolivian Confederation was originally a short-lived entity in the early 19th century. It arose from the division of the Peruvian Republic and the civil wars of 1834 and 1835 to 1836 and included the state of Bolivian State. Modern talks are minimal, but it is nevertheless ever present in the political atmosphere of the Bolivian and Peruvian people. It is time to consider this new tomorrow for our people."

Integrating this nation solidifies another strong position for our now diversified economy."
