 Burma.14.d: "Following a growing diplomatic proximity between us and the government of [BRM.GetNameDef], the Burmese government has reached out to us with an intriguing offer. While it may be useful to have a military ally on our southern border, forming an official alliance with the Burmese may increase regional anxiety about our geopolitical ambitions."

The government has announced today that is time we reform the law and allow for the Rohingya to gain citizenship in our great nation. They will always be one of our people.\n"
 Burma.18.a: "A Great Step for Us"
 #News Events#

 Burma_News.1.t: "A New Path for Myanmar?"
 Burma_News.1.d: "The military government today announced that the decades-long process of drafting a new constitution has finally been completed. While the new constitution marks a liberalising shift in Myanmar's politics, it nonetheless preserves the military's continued role in government, such as by ensuring its possession of 25% of the seats in parliament. It remains to be seen whether this constitution will be a vehicle for democratisation or a tool for continued military domination."
 Burma_News.1.a: "A cause for celebration?"
 Burma_News.2.t: "Aung San Suu Kyi Released"
 Burma_News.2.d: "After an extended period of resistance, the military government has finally caved into local and international pressure to release Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. This momentous decision follows the release of other prominent opposition politicians."
 Burma_News.2.a: "The Nobel prize winner walks."
 Burma_News.3.t: "The NLD Comes to Power in Myanmar "
 Burma_News.3.d: "In a remarkable turn of events the NLD has come to government, marking the end of close to 50 years of military rule. However, commentators remain divided on whether the NLD will truly be able to steer the country in a different direction, or whether the military will continue to exercise power albeit from behind the scenes."
 Burma_News.3.a: "It had to happen eventually."
 Burma_News.4.t: "A quiet struggle for dominance"
 Burma_News.4.d: "Reports are beginning to emerge about attempts by the civilian government of Myanmar to undermine the political influence of the country's military, the Tatmadaw. While the military's material strength is undoubtedly superior, analysts predict that the civilian government will seek to undermine the military's popular support and pressure the military indirectly through supporting popular protest. How the Tatmadaw will react to these moves remains uncertain."
 Burma_News.4.a: "An uncertain path lies before this country."
 Burma_News.5.t: "An End to Peace"
 Burma_News.5.d: "[BRM.GetLeader] today proclaimed that the government will no longer pursue ceasefires with the various rebel groups fighting the central government. This marks a significant shift in policy from the government's normal cycle of ceasefires and clashes with rebel groups."
 Burma_News.5.a: "War is coming"
 Burma_News.6.t: "The [BRM.GetName]"
 Burma_News.6.d: "The nation formerly known as the Union of Myanmar has officially become a Federation, marking a major shift in the government's attitude towards the ethnic minorities that dominate its border regions. The government had previously refused to grant any significant autonomy to these regions, including the Shan, Karen and Kachin states, but after years of conflict the government has finally accepted that this policy was not viable in the long term."
 Burma_News.6.a: "This was inevitable"
 Burma_News.7.t: "Myanmar cracks down on protests"
 Burma_News.7.d: "Information coming out of Myanmar has been scarce in recent weeks but it has become clear that the government has responded violently to peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations, launching a crackdown of monumental proportions. Western leaders and the United Nations Secretary-General have vocally denounced the violence in Myanmar. China and Russia have not publicly commented on the crackdown, but have vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning the violence."
 Burma_News.7.a: "How awful!"
 Burma_News.7.b: "It had to happen eventually"
 Burma_News.8.t: "The Insurgency has been Crushed"
 Burma_News.8.d: "Today [BRM.GetLeader] announced the last of Myanmar's ethnic rebellions has been wiped out. After decades of fighting, the government's adoption of a new strategy towards the insurgency, focusing on each remaining rebel group one at a time and refusing any possibility of compromise, has finally brought the conflict to a close. However, this achievement has come at a cost. Myanmar's relations with China have been perhaps irrevocably damaged by the military campaign. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have taken refuge within China's borders and dozens of Chinese citizens have been killed or injured by the fighting, not to mention China's chagrin at having its close ally, the United Wa State Army, shattered by the tatmadaw. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether the ethnic minorities now under military occupation will continue to accept the rule of the central government if all that is compelling them to do so is fear of the military's brutality."
 Burma_News.8.a: "Peace in our time?"
 Burma_News.9.t: "ASEAN Mutual Defence Treaty Signed"
 Burma_News.9.d: "Today the collective leaders of the ASEAN member states announced the signing of a Mutual Defence Treaty. “This day will be remembered through the ages as a remarkable moment of diplomatic cooperation for an interest far greater than that of any one nation” pronounced [BRM.GetLeader]."

 Insurgency.11.t: "The government has offered us a ceasefire"
 Insurgency.11.d: "Clearly in awe of our military prowess, the cowardly Tatmadaw has requested a cessation of hostilities. As despicable as our enemies are, a ceasefire may also be in our own interests, as we can use this opportunity to push for concessions from the Burmese."
 Insurgency.11.a: "We should make ambitious demands."
 Insurgency.11.b: "We should make moderate demands."
 Insurgency.11.c: "Screw them, we should reject their offer."
 Insurgency.12.t: "The rebels are pushing for outrageously large concessions!"

 Insurgency.12.b: "Reject their demands"
 Insurgency.13.t: "The rebels are making reasonable demands"

 Insurgency.16.a: "The struggle continues."
 Insurgency.18.t: "The government has invited us to negotiations of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement"
 Insurgency.18.d: "The new government has announced an ambitious proposal to make peace with all of the major ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) in Myanmar. We are among one of the 15 largest groups that have been invited to the negotiations. If we attend these talks, we will have a seat at the table in what could be the negotiations that shape the future of Myanmar."
 Insurgency.18.a: "Let's see how this goes."
 Insurgency.18.b: "This is a waste of time."
 Insurgency.19.t: "The First Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.19.d: "One of the most significant issues regarding the conflict in Myanmar is whether the state of Myanmar should be a union or a federation. Historically, the Burmese government has refused to accept the possibility of Myanmar becoming a federation, as, painfully aware of the legacy of colonial divide-and-rule, it fears that such a move would lead to the disintegration of the country. The ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) on the other hand have insisted on the need for a more representative form of government. Going forward in these negotiations, we should establish what our negotiation position on this particular issue is."
 Insurgency.19.a: "We must preserve the Union."
 Insurgency.19.b: "Times are changing and so must we, we should become a Federation."
 Insurgency.19.c: "We should compromise on this point."
 Insurgency.20.t: "The Second Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.20.d: "The next issue on the agenda concerns the composition of the Tatmadaw. Many EAOs argue that the nation's armed forces cannot be overwhelmingly dominated by Buddhists and ethnic Burmans as it is at the moment. We must consider whether or not to address these concerns."
 Insurgency.20.a: "Keep to the status quo."
 Insurgency.20.b: "Commit ourselves to improving minority representation in the military."
 Insurgency.20.c: "This issue is too significant to decide right now."
 Insurgency.21.t: "The Final Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.21.d: "The biggest stumbling block that we have encountered in these negotiations is whether to pursue disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) or security sector reform (SSR). The Tatmadaw has historically preferred DDR due to its desire to completely disarm the EAOs or bring them under its own command. The EAOs however have preferred SSR, a framework which would allow them to be integrated into the country's security sector whilst keeping their arms and their autonomy. We should consider the best solution to this impasse."
 Insurgency.21.a: "They cannot keep their arms. We choose DDR."
 Insurgency.21.b: "We must make some sacrifices, and so will accept SSR."
 Insurgency.21.c: "This issue is too important to decide at this moment."
 Insurgency.22.t: "We are satisfied with this draft"
 Insurgency.22.d: "The government has made enough concessions for us to bring this signed draft back to our people and carry ourselves with pride."
 Insurgency.22.a: "We will sign."
 Insurgency.23.t: "This draft is not acceptable!"
 Insurgency.23.d: "The government and the military clearly have no desire to draft an agreement worth any more than the paper is printed on! If we were to take this back to our people they would surely skin us alive."
 Insurgency.23.a: "We will not sign!"
 Insurgency.24.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has signed the NCA!"
 Insurgency.24.d: "Finding our negotiation position tolerable, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has joined us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.24.a: "Wonderful!"
 Insurgency.25.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to sign the NCA!"
 Insurgency.25.d: "Citing our 'unreasonable' demands, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to join us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.25.a: "Their loss."
 Insurgency.26.t: "Shan rebels have attacked our financial interests!"
 Insurgency.26.d: "Clearly trying to curry favour with Thailand and other states, the Shan rebels have taken it upon themselves to undermine our drug-trafficking capabilities. We must decide on a suitable response to this aggression, with possibilities ranging from doing nothing at all to attacking some of their strongholds or even declaring all-out war."
 Insurgency.26.a: "This means war!"
 Insurgency.26.b: "Our response should be proportionate."
 Insurgency.26.c: "We cannot respond at this point in time."
 Insurgency.27.t: "The United Wa State Army has retaliated!"
 Insurgency.27.d: "In response to our attacks on their drug trafficking assets, the UWSA has launched attacks on some of our border outposts. While we managed to repel them, we have suffered some casualties."
 Insurgency.27.a: "Regrettable."

 Rohingya_Crisis_desc: "Rakhine state has seen occasional outbursts of violence between Muslims describing themselves as “Rohingya” and local Rakhine Buddhists as well as the tatmadaw. The often brutal treatment of the Rohingya by the state of Myanmar has drawn strong condemnation from human rights organizations and Western countries, while Buddhist Nationalists in Rakhine state and elsewhere in Myanmar see the violence as a justified measure against illegal Bengali immigrants."

 Ethnic_Insurgencies_desc: "Since independence Myanmar has been engulfed by ethnic insurgencies in its remote, isolated border regions. Ethnic groups including the Karen, Kachin, Shan and many others see the central government as overwhelmingly Burman and Buddhist and so have taken up arms to preserve their unique ways of life."

 A_Political_Military_desc: "Ever since the 1962 Burmese coup the Tatmadaw has been the dominant force in the politics of Myanmar. A disdain for civilian rule, democracy and freedom of speech on the one hand and a unified military culture shaped by decades of intense counterinsurgency warfare on the other have combined to produce a cohesive and politically active military. Signs that this is beginning to change have only recently begun to emerge."

 Buddhism_Official_desc: "Having a state religion may appeal to some of the most devout Buddhists, but there is a reason for Burma going through most of its history without one. Having Buddhism as a state religion antagonizes those who subscribe to Christianity, Islam or one of Burma's many other religions. Having a state religion severely exacerbates tensions between the central government and the various often non-Buddhist ethnic rebel groups."

These ceasefires have been punctuated by violent clashes between the Tatmadaw and EAOs, clashes which have often, but not always, resulted in nothing more than a return to the status quo. The balance between peace and war is a delicate one, and it is one that both sides must handle carefully.\n\nThe level of influence Myanmar has in any particular EAO determines whether Myanmar can annex the rebel territory or whether the breakaway state can declare independence. Ceasefires will allow Myanmar to accumulate influence in EAOs slowly over an extended period of time.
