 #Needs rework
 MD4_election_campaign.0.t: "Election campaign heating up as race enters final two weeks"
 MD4_election_campaign.0.d: "Since the last election on [Root.GetLastElection], [Root.GetLeader] has been steadily steering [Root.GetName]. With the final votes to be cast in two weeks, this direction will be challenged by powerful rivals.\n\nMost of the campaign's advertising spending has already taken place and polls are starting to pick up the effects."
 MD4_election_campaign.0.a: "Let's go!"

 MD4_election_campaign.1.t: "Foreign Policy Debate: [Root.GetLeader] faces tough decisions about who to attack"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.d: "As the final voting draws ever closer, we have to decide who to contrast our foreign policy with. As the world becomes an increasingly tumultuous place, this issue has become particularly important to voters.\n\nSome hard-hitting negative ads will surely make our opponent's popularity tumble but there is a small chance they may successfully counter this if they have some serious dirt on us or if our attacks were based on very poor research.\n\nThe effectiveness of the attack is determined by the amount of campaign funding we received."
 MD4_election_campaign.1.a: "Attack the [Root.GetFascistParty] lunatics"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.b: "Attack the Nationalist idiots"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.c: "Attack the [Root.GetNeutralParty] fools"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.e: "Attack the [Root.GetCommunistParty] imbeciles"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.f: "Attack the [Root.GetDemocraticParty] morons"
 MD4_election_campaign.1.g: "Refrain from attacking anyone"
 MD_election_campaign_no_tt: "No Effect"

 MD4_election_campaign.3.t: "[Root.GetFascistParty] recover - strengthened from attacks"
 MD4_election_campaign.3.d: "Despite our ferocious attacks against them, the controversial [Root.GetFascistParty] have managed to retain all their core followers. They used the increased attention from our negative ads to their advantage, gaining unprecedented access across all major news outlets to push their ideology."
 MD4_election_campaign.3.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.4.t: "Negative attacks against the nationalists backfire"
 MD4_election_campaign.4.d: "Despite our ferocious attacks against them, the controversial nationalists have managed to retain most of their core followers. They have scored major points across the nation, claiming that the system is broken and corrupt, that the mainstream media is manipulating society, and that [Root.GetLeader]'s policies are up for grabs to the highest bidder via campaign contributions."
 MD4_election_campaign.4.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.5.t: "Negative attacks against [Root.GetNeutralParty] fail to make impact"
 MD4_election_campaign.5.d: "Despite our best efforts, the tide of public opinion has shifted against our negative ad campaign targeting the [Root.GetNeutralParty]. There are likely several causes but one factor may be the perception that an attack from a politician of [Root.GetLeader]'s stature is an example of \"punching down\" and that the increased media coverage of our opponent's enabled them to reach out to more voters."
 MD4_election_campaign.5.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.6.t: "Negative attacks against [Root.GetCommunistParty] fall on deaf ears"
 MD4_election_campaign.6.d: "Despite our best efforts, the tide of public opinion has shifted against our negative ad campaign targeting the [Root.GetCommunistParty]. There are likely several causes but one factor may be the perception that an attack from a politician of [Root.GetLeader]'s stature is an example of \"punching down\" and that the increased media coverage of our opponent's enabled them to reach out to more voters."
 MD4_election_campaign.6.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.7.t: "Negative attacks against [Root.GetDemocraticParty] backfire"
 MD4_election_campaign.7.d: "Despite our best efforts, the tide of public opinion has shifted against our negative ad campaign targeting the [Root.GetDemocraticParty]. While we have publicly blamed foreign interference, behind closed doors the real suspicion is that our attacks were so exaggerated that only a few people ever even believed in them in the first place."
 MD4_election_campaign.7.a: "Damn it!"

 MD4_election_campaign.8.t: "Invite a controversial speaker to the campaign?"
 MD4_election_campaign.8.d: "Ordinarily this would never even be suggested out loud - let alone considered seriously. But due to [Root.GetLeader]'s low approval rating, it might be a risk worth taking; The speaker is a fringe member of our party, known for making a number of controversial statements in the past and speaking at inopportune times. However, they are very popular among students and young people - a key group we need to convince to vote our way."
 MD4_election_campaign.8.a: "Invite them and hope for the best"
 MD4_election_campaign.8.b: "Don't risk it"

 MD4_election_campaign.9.t: "Huge rally turnout reinvigorates enthusiasm for [Root.GetLeader]"
 MD4_election_campaign.9.d: "The rally was a great success, attracting the largest audience turnout of the whole campaign season. Not only did the controversial speaker heap praise on [Root.GetLeader] and preach party unity; it was done in such an enthusiastic and convincing way that nobody suspected it was actually [Root.GetLeader]'s team who had written the remarks in their entirety."
 MD4_election_campaign.9.a: "A much-needed boost for the campaign"

 MD4_election_campaign.10.t: "Disaster for [Root.GetLeader]'s Campaign"
 MD4_election_campaign.10.d: "With the largest audience turnout of the campaign season, the stage was set for [Root.GetLeader] to shine. Unfortunately, the controversial co-speaker who was invited to whip up enthusiasm, proceeded to tear up the speech we had prepared, and instead went off on a long tirade about the \"failures of all administrations, including this one\" and then appealed to young people to \" vote with their heart, or stay home\" \n\nNeedless to say, this soundbite was subsequently plastered across the media - with our opponents watching on gleefully."
 MD4_election_campaign.10.a: "What a failure!"

 election_coalition_won.0.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Elections: Government Coalition wins majority!"
 election_coalition_won.0.d: "The current ruling parties have achieved a majority in the new parliament and can extend their mandate to rule together."
 election_coalition_won.0.a: "Continue with the current government"

 election_single_party.1.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Elections: [Root.GetLeader] defeated!"
 election_single_party.1.d: "With [show_biggest_party_elect] single-handedly winning a majority of parliamentary seats, [Root.GetLeader]'s political future is essentially over, with [Root.GetRulingParty] members calling for  resignation.\n\n[show_biggest_party_elect] will immediately take over as the new government of [Root.GetName]."

We have only one choice - chaos or order and freedom. TOTAL ORDER. And TOTAL FREEDOM from foreign parasites."
 coalition.21.a: "Yeah! Let's team up."
 coalition.21.b: "Government? You all belong in a different institution..."

 coalition.22.t: "Negotiations with [Nat_Autocracy_L] ([?party_pop_elect_array^22|%0])"
 coalition.22.d: "Dear [Root.GetLeader]. There comes a time, of national peril, when the military establishment must step up it's role, to fill dangerous power vacuums, safeguard the national sovereignty and our independence and patriotic values. In our view, this time for military rule - is always. However, we realize that doing so now might bring certain undesirable effects on our foreign relations. It would be... less complicated - if you just discretely do as we say.\n\nAs long as you know your place, we certainly would be a very powerful political ally for you."
 coalition.22.a: "Politics is too important to be left to the politicians"
 coalition.22.b: "Politics is too important to be left to the generals"

 coalition.23.t: "Negotiations with [Monarchist_L] ([?party_pop_elect_array^23|%0])"
 coalition.23.d: "Respected [Root.GetLeader]. Us royalists scoff at the notion that you, a commoner, could ever provide [Root.GetName] with the necessary stability and other splendid advantages that only an absolute monarch can bestow. We all know that true supreme executive power can only be properly wielded by royalty in all their holiness. It truly would be a unifying force and a powerful symbol of our greatness, as we march towards full national restoration. Clearly, absolute monarchies, blessed by divine right, outperform all other forms of government in all metrics.\n\nAlright, so we are obviously not going to crown you, so we might keep the outdated and anachronistic republican government for some time, while we royalists in the coalition search for the best candidate for the throne."
 coalition.23.a: "Yeah, sure, whatever"
 coalition.23.b: "You lot are clearly not fit for governing..."

 MANAGE_SUBJECTS_TT: "§YSubjects Menu§!\nSubjects represent any nation that is a satellite, puppet, dominion, special administrative region, or any country that is subservient to another. Each country will behave differently to you being their overlord and, as such, will fight for their independence, or they will allow the eventual integration if your country is popular with theirs.\n\n§YIntegrating subjects allows you to gain cores on their lands so it makes them an attractive alternative to annexation.§!\n"
