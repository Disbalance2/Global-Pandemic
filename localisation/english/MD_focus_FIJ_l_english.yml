####Fijian Dynamic Modifiers####
fijian_homelessness_crisis: "Homelessness Crisis"
fijian_homelessness_crisis_desc: "With the political instability in the nation the government has completely lacked in corrective and decisive action by the government to attend to the growing homeless crisis. As the new millennia begins many wonder if the government can actually fix this growing crisis that plaguing the nation. Nevertheless, time will tell if the government can not only look after the nation but even begin to look after themselves."
fijian_emigration_crisis: "Mass Emigration Crisis"
fijian_emigration_crisis_desc: "With political instability, climate change and rising ethnic tensions the minds to change Fiji have seen it best to leave Fiji for better lives. It's up to the new government to set the ground for a better tomorrow, but with so many odds against them, can the government of Fiji stand the test of time itself."
fijian_military: "The Fijian Military"
fijian_military_desc: "Throughout the island's independence, the Fijian military has been a good self-defense force. However, even with its limited involvement in foreign missions the Fijian military is little to nothing in terms of experience. As the island is pulled into the modern age and more political unrest being feared many wonder how many times more will the military have to keep the peace."
fijian_economic_condition: "The Fijian Economy"
fijian_economic_condition_desc: "Despite a modest population and landmass the Fijian economy is a well-deversified one. The mining industry excells in things like copper, gold and silver, with secondary industries also affecting mining include things like a strong cement and boating. Overall the Fijian economy has a reletively strong base to work with and as the new millennia kicks in it is up to the government to help further diversify the economy branching into new industries like high tech and software development."
fijian_ethnic_tensions: "Indo-Fijian Tensions"
fijian_ethnic_tensions_desc: "Since independence, the island of Fiji has seen a fairly modest growth in its population. However the downside to this notion is that the vast majority of the people migrating to Fiji have been of Indian heritage. While to most this means nothing, unfortunately to a fair amount of the ethnic Fijian peoples this feels like replacement and sidelining. Throughout the islands' recent history with independence, these tensions have only increased dramatically, it is up to the government of Fiji to solve this before something serious happens....ignore the several coups which permeate the nation's history please."

##2000 Coup Events##
fiji_news.1.t: "Nationalist Kidnap Government Officials"
fiji_news.1.d: "Earlier today on May 19th 2000 members of the Pro ethnic Fijian political movement known as i-Taukei have taken hostage key members of the newly elected and mostly ethnically Indo-Fijian government. The prime minister and several key goverment officials were taken hostage in the parliament building with the i-Taukei members pretty much barricaded inside. Negotiations are ongoing to extract the hostages without loss of life."
fiji_news.1.o1: "Why Must We Fight Each Other"
fiji_news.2.t: "Interim Government Created"
fiji_news.2.d: "Following the events and a stalemate on negotiations with the rebels, President Kamisese Mara declared a state of emergency and has created a continued government from what was left of the currently held hostage government members not captured. Tensions are high as local police and Republic of Fiji Military Forces or the RFMF have been stretched with creating the failing cordon around the parliament along with dealing with growing protest and civil unrest as protesters targeted several Indo-Fijian businesses in Suva."
fiji_news.2.o1: "Can't We Do Anything!?"
fiji_news.3.t: "Lost Authority Cause Military Coup"
fiji_news.3.d: "As the remnants of the civilian government have proven their inability to genuinely exercise executive authority, the RFMF Commander Frank Bainimarama has ousted the standing government and established their own. Their first action was establishing martial law, giving them more freedom to deal with the massive amounts of civil unrest."
fiji_news.3.o1: "Here We Go Again"
fiji_news.3.o2: "The Military Will Solve This"
fiji_news.4.t: "Gun Fire Exchanged at parliament"
fiji_news.4.d: "Following the military's coup, the 1997 constitution was revoked, negotiations broke down with the military issuing an ultimatum. Foreign powers began a host of sactions from Fiji being removed from the commonwealth, several nations banning Fijian goods and Fijian sports teams being banned. These reponses were due to the notion of giving into the rebel demands. On the 12th of June the military fired warning shots at George Speight's vehicle, though Speight claims it was a failed assassination attempt. Negotiations are still on going and more hostages have been released. With civil unrest calming down and things looking hopeful many wonder how much longer will this last."
fiji_news.4.o1: "Please End This Senseless Violence"
fiji_news.5.t: "Military Agrees With Rebels?"
fiji_news.5.d: "On July 3rd 2000 Bainimarama named Laisenia Qarase as Prime Minister, heading an all-indigenous Fijian government. Speight was outraged by the decision, and a gun-battle broke out at Parliament the next day in which five people were injured. Chaos escalated, and rebels staged a number of incidents around the country. Soldiers at the Sukunaivalu Barracks in Labasa mutinied and declared support for Speight. Local landowners took over the Monasavu Dam, cutting power to Suva. On the 8th rebels blocked the road between Suva and Nadi and stormed a police station in Korovou, taking 30 hostages. At Naboro Prison, 50 inmates rioted, taking guards hostage"
fiji_news.5.o1: "What Is Bananarama Thinking!?!"
fiji_news.6.t: "The Coup Ends"
fiji_news.6.d: "Throughout the months of June and July semi-continual negotiations would permeate the nation as a reform of the civilian government would be talked and talked about. Eventually more and more hostages would be released with the rebels leaving the parliament building and migrating from the capital area. Eventually on the 26th of July Speight and his spokesperson Joe Nata were arrested near a military checkpoint after threats towards the new president and of civil war were lobbed from the two rebel leaders. Soon after the military would storm the rebel headquarters arresting 369 additional rebels. The civilian coup was declared ended, not long after George Speight would be tried for treason and sentenced to death."
fiji_news.6.o1: "Peace At Last...But At What Cost?"
fiji_news.7.t: "United Fiji Secures Victory"
fiji_news.7.d: "The 1997 Constitution of Fiji required general elections for the House of Representatives to be held at least once every five years. Acting President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi issued a proclamation on 2 March 2006, effective from March 27th, dissolving Parliament. The previous parliamentary term had been due to expire on October 1st 2006. The Writ of Elections was issued on March 28th; candidates filed their nominations on April 11th and published their preference lists on the 13th, while voter registration closed on April 4th. General elections were held in Fiji between May 6th and 13th of 2006. The incumbent Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) government, led by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, was re-elected for a third term in government. The main opposition bing the Labour Party, led by Mahendra Chaudhry, as well as several other minor parties."
fiji_news.7.o1: "Steady As She Goes."
fiji_news.8.t: "Military Demands"
fiji_news.8.d: "On October 16th 2006, the RFMF Commander Commodore Bainimarama issued an ultimatum for the government to meet nine demands or resign by December 1st. The nine demands mainly centered around the 2000 coup proponents being brought to justice; withdrawing any political machinations which would potentially further economic inequality based on racial grounds; denying intervention by foreign authority (mentioning by name Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes, an Australian national); dropping the court proceedings regarding the military's statements from earlier in the year and formally addressing concerns about government spending and internal governance. A week and a half later, on October 31st 2006, the military staged exercises around Suva and closed off the city's army barracks. The military said that the exercises were not threatening."

The developments here were fast and swift showing that the military itself seems united in this endeavor of the Commodore's will.

fiji_news.10.d: "With the recent coup establishing Commodore Frank Banimarama as the defacto leader of the nation, many now wonder what honestly lies next for Fiji. Some ranking members within the coup seem to be agitating for a more firmer stance on how the nation is ruled. With one saying that the petty squabbles of the ethnic turmoil being the greatest cock-up the nation has had to endure, let alone tear itself apart for.

fiji_news.11.d: "The Growing factionalism within the military junta has seen a rise of old ideas with new flavor. The faction known as the House of Suva seems to want to create an elected monarchy, a sort of old titles with new principles. Rather than tying the title to blood, the ideas of elections and the principle of democracy would still be there. This hybridization of monarchism with democratic electoralism would be the fundamental basis of their platform. One of the faction members even states quote, Now you can tell your son or daughter that if you work hard enough and seek out your goals in life you too could be a prince, princess or maybe even a king or queen. Many are unsure about the proposition but it does seem to appeal with the council of chiefs and of the tribal heritage of the island's people."

Rumors tell of a faction forming called the Technate Council, this council seems to be apart of the niche hush hush party known as the Technocracy Party of Fiji. But many of the protest movements against the apparatus of the coup just wish to move on, with signs increasingly popping up for the Fiji Labour Party to just take charge since it had second place in the election results.

fiji_news.401.t: "Rumors Of Raid Grow"
fiji_news.401.d: "Recently there have been rumors that a sect of the military junta under more radically minded leaders has come up with a plan to storm the parliament building and take out the hostages. The Commodore has been seen scrambling to find these radical officers in order to prevent a national crisis not seen since the first coup back in the 1980s.

In the chaos of the week long event, sources say that Commodore Frank Bainimarama was found dead in a heavily damaged convoy.

fiji_news.500.d: "Military units have been suddenly called away from the already abismal cordon around the parliament building. Sources state that gunfire and tire screeching were heard near the outskirts of Suva itself. Many question what happened to cause such a drastic change in the apparatus of the military's counter coup to what remained of the civilian government. Further still, the initial Ethno-Nationalist leader which started the inital coup has made drastic calls to talk with him or start facing consequences for their inaction. We hope to have news soon on what has transpired."

fiji_news.501.t: "The Bloody Results Are In"
fiji_news.501.d: "In a stark contrast to the modern world we live in, it turns out a volatile sect of the military ambushed the Commodore's convoy and subsequently forced the council of Chief's to legalize the House of Suva. This bloodied ascent has resulted in the nation becoming a monarchy, despite the nation's history of gaining independence from a monarchy. A recent interview with one of the supposed House Council stated that quote \"We seek to have a firm rule, a just rule and a godly rule over the nation. While yes we are installing a form of Martial Law until the Ethno-Nationalist are handled, we nevertheless do not plan to abolish elections.\" Many are skeptical of the claims, however a vast majority just want the chaos to stop. We'll see what the end result is by this blood created crown of theirs."

As a result of this shift the once constitutionally abiding coup was now being turned into a full on military Junta. While Rear Admiral Naupoto is a fresh face in the political scene he is not a blind man per say, as such the people wonder how will he lead the nation and its people to better times."
Laisenia_Qarase_desc: "Laisenia Qarase was a compromise candidate established during the 2000 coup. Not too left leaning, ethnically Fijian and not too right leaning for the time. He would go on to win the 2001 snap election and surprisingly the 2006 election as well. Though by 2006 his views and party had changed to be more ethnically Fijian aligned, some proposed controversial bills in his 2006 tenure would create the constitutional crisis which would lead to the 2006 coup by the military."

However an agitator from an ethno-nationalist movement decided to take matters into their own hands and as such kidnap the elected goverment. Following the events of said coup the United Fiji Party would be established and officially elected in the post coup snap elections. Mahendra Chaudhry would attempt another bid for the Prime Minister position in the 2006 general election."

King_Sitiveni_I_desc: "Sitiveni Rabuka now officially given the title King Sitiveni I of the House of Suva. The leading member and some argue potentially the founder of the House of Suva. Rabuka made a name and legacy with his political and military career, along with being involved in one way or another in nearly every coup the nation has had. Stability, Order, Peace... These three pillars are what Rabuka has strived to keep and with this new path many wonder if he can create a real legacy."
King_Sitiveni_II_desc: "Jioji Konrote now officially given the title King Sitiveni II of the House of Suva. The former Major General and politician was elected by the people in the first election cycle of the post coup era. The name Sitiveni is a symbol in the crown council. The symbol being that one of the leading members and some argue potentially the founder of the House of Suva, Sitiveni Rabuka. With the naming convention being set as a precedent many wonder if the following leaders will choose the symbol or possibly stake their own claim in the numeric game."
