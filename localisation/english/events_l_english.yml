 generic.1.d_neutral_good: "For a long time the [From.GetAdjective] government has sought to align the path of our countries, and has expressed a great interest in [Root.GetAdjective] politics. Recently this intensified when [From.GetRulingParty] started pushing their [From.GetRulingIdeology] propaganda with a number of speeches and reading material distributed to the [Root.GetAdjective] people. \n\nNow even a number of politicians and other officials are being swayed by the [From.GetAdjective] propaganda, and have started advocating for [From.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] in [Root.GetName]."
 generic.1.d_bad: "For a long time the [From.GetAdjective] government has sought to align the path of our countries, and has often tried to meddle in [Root.GetName]'s politics. Recently this has intensified, as [From.GetRulingParty] started pushing their [From.GetRulingIdeology] propaganda with no respect for [Root.GetAdjective] political traditions. A number of speeches and other [From.GetRulingIdeology] material is already being distributed to the [Root.GetAdjective] people. It seems that even a number of politicians and other officials are being swayed by the [From.GetAdjective] propaganda and have begun advocating for [From.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] in [Root.GetName]."

Pilots returning from the region report having spotted [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetWingShort] going down in flames over [From.GetMissionRegion] after taking heavy enemy fire.

 election.1.t: "GENERIC ELECTION"
 election.1.d: ""
 election.1.a: ""
 election.2.t: "Election: Public Opposes Rearmament"
 election.2.d: "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people have confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."
 election.2.a: "The people must be heard."
 election.2.b: "Protecting our sovereignty comes first."
 election.3.t: "Election: Public Demands Rearmament"
 election.3.d: "The ongoing war approaching our borders has loomed over the upcoming election, with many voters being concerned that [Root.GetName] is not prepared for being thrown into this conflict or whatever may arise from it. They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."
 election.3.a: "The people have the right to feel safe."
 election.3.b: "Many are still in favor of diplomatic solutions."
 election.4.t: "Election: Fascists in Government?"
 election.4.d: "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."
 election.4.a: "Rather them than the communists!"
 election.4.b: "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t: "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d: "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 election.5.a: "Rather reform than revolution!"
 election.5.b: "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.6.t: "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 election.6.d: "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either fascists or communists."
 election.6.a: "We will work with the fascists to strengthen [Root.GetName]."
 election.6.b: "Joining with the communists, we can facilitate social change."
 election.6.c: "A minority government, although weak, is preferable."
 election.7.t: "Fascists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.7.d: "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 election.7.a: "We can use some allies against greater threats."
 election.7.b: "With friends like that, we'd need no enemies."
 election.8.t: "Communists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.8.d: "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 election.8.a: "We should embrace our common causes."
 election.8.b: "Down that path lies the dissolution of [Root.GetName] itself."
 election.11.t: "Election: Fascist Majority"
 election.11.d: "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.11.a: "It is a black day for [Root.GetName], but the people have spoken."
 election.11.b: "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 election.12.t: "Election: Communist Majority"
 election.12.d: "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 election.12.a: "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
 election.12.b: "We must stop them before they abolish every sign of dissenting thought!"
 election.13.t: "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 election.13.d: "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."
 election.13.a: "He can say what he pleases, we need not endorse it."
 election.13.b: "We cannot rely on fascists to develop and protect [Root.GetName]."
 election.14.t: "Election: Wartime Exception"
 election.14.d: "[Root.GetName] is in a state of war. Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."
 election.14.a: "Elections will be held as usual."
 election.14.b: "We can take care of such matters when this war is through."
 election.15.t: "Election: Government Contested"
 election.15.d: "With an upcoming election, people are beginning to question the capability of the current administration to pursue the ongoing war. [Root.GetName] has suffered greatly and popular opinion has turned against those who seem to be leading our nation to defeat. While our people are determined to see the war to the end, they would rather see another government ending it."
 election.15.a: "This crisis of trust is highly unfortunate."
 election.15.b: "Let the political landscape shift to keep the people united."
 election.16.t: "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d: "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a: "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t: "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d: "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."
 election.17.a: "Splitters!"
 political.1.t: "Communism on the Rise"
 political.1.d: "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.1.a: "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.1.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for a communist coup."
 political.1.b: "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 political.1.b.tt: "Increases the chance of popular support for a communist uprising."
 political.2.t: "Marxist Sympathies in Government"
 political.2.d: "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 political.2.a: "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 political.2.a.tt: "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t: "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d: "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a: "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t: "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d: "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a: "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t: "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d: "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a: "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t: "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d: "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a: "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 political.6.b: "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."
 political.7.t: "Fascism on the Rise"
 political.7.d: "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.7.a: "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 political.7.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for a fascist coup."
 political.7.b: "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 political.7.b.tt: "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
 political.8.t: "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d: "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a: "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t: "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d: "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a: "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t: "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d: "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a: "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b: "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t: "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d: "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a: "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t: "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d: "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a: "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t: "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d: "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 political.13.a: "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 political.13.a.tt: "Increases the chance of internal support for arranging elections."
 political.13.b: "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 political.13.b.tt: "Increases the chance of people voicing support for democracy and forming an opposition."
 political.14.t: "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d: "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a: "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt: "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t: "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d: "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a: "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t: "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d: "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
 political.16.a: "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 political.16.b: "Let the people be heard."
 political.17.t: "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 political.17.d: "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.17.a: "Those loyal to the [Root.GetRulingParty] will support the decision now."
 political.17.b: "The reforms need broader support before an election can be held."
 political.18.t: "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 political.18.d: "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 political.18.a: "Suppress this hateful movement!"
 political.18.b: "Don't pay any attention to them."
 political.18.c: "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 political.19.t: "Communists Demand Referendum"
 political.19.d: "Marxist ideas took root in [Root.GetName] a long time ago, but have gained much more widespread support lately. The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."
 political.19.a: "Un-[Root.GetAdjective] activities must be stopped!"
 political.19.b: "Ignore them, they're just causing trouble."
 political.19.c: "The referendum is preferable to a bloody revolt."
 political.20.t: "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 political.20.d: "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 political.20.a: "Round them up."
 political.20.b: "Just proceed as usual."
 political.20.c: "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 political.21.t: "Fascists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 political.21.d: "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 political.21.a: "We will stop them at any cost!"
 political.21.b: "The fascists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 political.22.t: "Communists Rise Up"
 political.22.d: "After their request for a referendum was denied, the few reformers of the communist movement in [Root.GetName] rapidly lost influence to the more radical elements. With the [Root.GetRulingParty]'s refusal to acknowledge the public support for the suggested reforms, the romantic view of the revolution gradually grew more widespread and the leaders of the movement become those who could most easily start a riot. Those riots have now erupted into a full-scale civil war, with the future of the nation at stake."
 political.22.a: "We won't allow them to ruin our country!"
 political.22.b: "The fire of the revolution must be extinguished with the blood of the oppressors!"
 political.23.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 political.23.d: "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 political.23.a: "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 political.23.b: "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 political.24.t: "Fascists Ridiculed"
 political.24.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 political.24.a: "What a bunch of clowns."
 political.25.t: "Communist Fad Blows Over"
 political.25.d: "Many communists had predicted that [Root.GetName] was going to be the next nation to fall to the so-called international revolution, but after a few months of strikes and red flags in the streets, the movement seems to have died down. The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
 political.25.a: "What a bunch of hypocrites."
 political.26.t: "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 political.26.d: "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."

We now see eye to eye with our fellow [Root.GetAdjective]s, and together we will rebuild our great nation.

Let us ask ourselves a better question: Does the future belong to the [From.GetAdjective] or does it belong to [Root.GetNameDef]?'\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech today suggested that [Root.GetName] is on the path to war.

 nuke_dropped.8.d: "A nuclear bomb was detonated today over the capital of the United States. In an attack clearly directed at the political center and historical legacy of the US, the White House, the Capitol and a number of monuments and memorials were wiped off the face of the Earth. Even the Burning of Washington over a century ago pales in comparison to the destruction visited upon the city by this devastating weapon.\n\nAlthough President [From.Owner.GetLeader] has been brought to safety, the nation has been shaken to its core. No doubt, the US hoped to be the first and only country to wield such a weapon. Those hopes have now been shattered in the worst possible way."
 nuke_dropped.8.a: "One nation, indivisible, versus one atom, divisible."
 nuke_dropped.8.b: "The eagle will rise from the ashes like a phoenix."
 nuke_dropped.9.t: "Atomic Bombing of Rome"
 nuke_dropped.9.d: "A nuclear explosion struck the city of Rome today, shocking people around the world. Due to its historical and artistic treasures, many had never thought the ancient city would be the target of such indiscriminate destruction. With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack. For a while, it looked like the city could aid the nation's recovery after the war was over. Those hopes have now been turned to dust, along with many people."
 nuke_dropped.9.a: "Bomba Iacta Est!"
 nuke_dropped.9.b: "Rome won't be rebuilt in one day..."
 nuke_dropped.10.t: "Atomic Bombing of Paris"
 nuke_dropped.10.d: "Today, a nuclear device was detonated over the city of Paris, causing widespread destruction and countless casualties. France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state. Perhaps the coming decades will see the birth of a new Paris, but Paris in the public mind, the city built in the Belle Époque, is gone forever."
 nuke_dropped.10.a: "The city of light has burned out."
 nuke_dropped.10.b: "Only yesterday, it seemed like we'd always have Paris."
 nuke_dropped.11.t: "Atomic Bombing of Moscow"
 nuke_dropped.11.d: "A city many have tried and failed to conquer, Moscow was the target of a nuclear attack today. The explosion was directed at the heart of [From.Owner.GetAdjective] leadership, the Kremlin having been nearly completely destroyed by the blast.\n\n[From.Owner.GetLeader], having grown more aware and fearful of all possible and impossible threats recently, evacuated in time and survived. However, even the vastness of [From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy. Indeed, if this continues, the nation will soon consist only of two kinds of wastelands: Those which were there in the first place, and those created by its enemies."
 nuke_dropped.11.a: "Won't a nuclear winter only make Moscow a more difficult target?"
 nuke_dropped.11.b: "They may burn every city we have, but they will never take them."
 nuke_dropped.12.t: "Atomic Bombing of Copenhagen"
 nuke_dropped.12.d: "Today, the city of Copenhagen was struck by a nuclear explosion. Having grown after escaping destruction in the Great War thanks to Denmark's neutrality, the capital has never experienced an attack close to this devastating since the Napoleonic Wars. The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack. It remains to be seen if this is the beginning of the end for one of Europe's oldest nations."
 nuke_dropped.12.a: "Something is irradiated in the state of Denmark."
 nuke_dropped.12.b: "The city has burned before, but not perished."
 nuke_dropped.12.c: "With plutonium we bring the Danes to their knees!"
 nuke_dropped.13.t: "Atomic Bombing of Stockholm"
 nuke_dropped.13.d: "The beautiful city of Stockholm, proud Venice of the North, was struck by a nuclear bomb today. Despite their best efforts to stay neutral in the past, the Swedes have now paid the ultimate price for international conflict. The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected. It has been decided that it should stand untouched forever as a monument to the city's resilience."
 nuke_dropped.13.a: "With this, Swedish neutrality will be but a memory."

[From.From.GetLeader] of the [From.From.GetRulingParty] has emerged as the new leader amid the turmoil.

Though [From.GetAdjective] leader [From.GetLeader] strongly denied the accusations, it is widely known that the two leaders don't see eye to eye. With [From.GetAdjective]-[From.From.GetAdjective] ties at all time low, [From.From.GetName] vowed to the public to \"irradicate [From.GetAdjective] influence from [From.From.GetName]\", and otherwise double down on the [From.From.GetRulingIdeology] direction that the ruling [From.From.GetRulingParty] have been steering [From.From.GetNameWithFlag] towards."

 News_influence.6.t: "Drama as [From.From.GetNameWithFlag] collapse into Civil War!"
 News_influence.6.d: "Traumatic scenes from [From.From.GetNameWithFlag] could be seen today, as the last few days of protests, uncertainty and strange military movements gave way to gunfire, suffering and fleeing civilians. While details are scarce, it seems several whole units of the [From.From.GetAdjective] Army have declared for the armed opposition against [From.From.GetLeader] and the [From.From.GetRulingParty] ([From.From.GetRulingIdeology]). A opposition leader, speaking to WNN under conditions of anonymity, said that they \"expect significant help from [From.GetNameWithFlag] in their quest to overthrow the illegitimate [From.From.GetAdjective] tyrant [From.From.GetLeader]\".\n\nAlthough [From.GetAdjective] leadership have expressed their \"surprise about these dramatic developments\", this is given little credibility by close watchers of [From.GetAdjective]-[From.From.GetAdjective] relations. One analyst described the situation like this; \"It's clear that this in reality was a [From.GetAdjective]-backed coup attempt that failed to secure their objectives fast enough, resulting in a tense standoff that degraded into what now looks like a full civil war\". Several world leaders, especially those with a [From.From.GetRulingIdeology] have had less than diplomatic words for the as of yet unconfirmed [From.GetAdjective] involvement.\n\nWith the two different sides in the conflict represent not only stark differences in domestic, but also international direction, it will be interesting to follow if other countries also get involved in the conflict."

Right now, this is coming to an end, fast. The prices are dropping, and people are trying to sell like there is no tomorrow. Many of the less fortunate will be stuck with huge loans they can't repay. As people are cursing both [Root.GetLeader] and the [Root.GetAdjective] Central Bank for causing this, we must make an public statement on how we intend to handle this crisis fast."

 econvent.2.b: "This is painful, but housing prices had to come down."

 econvent.3.t: "Stock Market Crash"
 econvent.3.d: "It seems the chaos following the bursting of the housing-bubble has reached the Stock Market. The share prices of nearly all listed [Root.GetAdjective] companies tumbled down heavily this morning, and our currency fell a great deal too.

Desperate financial moguls, their lobbyists, and the politicians they have made contributions to - all are swarming the [Root.GetAdjective] governing offices, and all have the same message: \"We need a bailout!\".\n\nApparently the dual shock of the Housing Downturn and the Stock Market Crash were too much for the financial sector to handle.

One theory is that we have become less competitive due to our relative high wages, another is that our competitors have increased the quality of their products. Others feel that the decrease in demand is just due to shifting trends abroad. Whatever the cause, there is not really much we can do about this except putting it behind us and working harder in the future."

 USA_2016_Recount.1.d: "After weeks of careful scrutiny, the final votes are being counted right now. This may be the closest election we've had in years. Yet the question remains. Who won the 2016 elections?"
 USA_2016_Recount.1.a: "After a close race, Donald Trump won the election."
 USA_2016_Recount.1.b: "After a close race, Hillary Clinton won the election."

 #Trump Wins 2016 Elections
 USA_2016_Recount_News.1.t: "Donald Trump Wins 2016 US Presidential Election."
 USA_2016_Recount_News.1.d: "Donald Trump has been confirmed the 45th President of the United States today after an election recount undertaken by Green Party President Jill Stein. Clinton, having conceded the election on November 9th, declined to call for a recount. Despite President-elect Trump's attempt to file legal motions to block the recounts, several other states were subject to recounts separate from Stein's efforts. These included Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida. Despite minor discrepancies, all states certified their original November 8th election results. \n\nWhile Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over three million votes, Trump carried enough swing states to net him a total of 301 electoral votes to Clinton's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South, Midwest, and surprisingly Pennsylvania."

After a tight race, Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton pushed for a recount on the grounds that unspecified \"anomalies\" may have affected the election's outcome. \n\nAccording to the recount results, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over four million votes, one million more than last reported. This was enough to carry enough swing states to net Hillary a total of 301 electoral votes to Trump's 227. As expected, Trump lost the Democratic strongholds of the West and upper East Coast, but won the American South. Pennsylvania and the American Midwest, while Red in the original count, turned blue after the latest findings."

 sco.6.d: "[FROM.GetAdjective] troops joined thousands of others today in what is being described as a counter-terrorism exercise under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). While many have hailed these exercises as a symptom of successful international cooperation, others have reacted much less enthusiastically to this latest development. American and European analysts cited the deployment of long-range aircraft and substantial firepower as evidence that these exercises are meant not as practice for counter-terror operations but as a well-armed dress rehearsal for confrontation with the West."

 ### Taiwan Events ###
 taiwan.1.t: "228 Hand-in-Hand rally"
 taiwan.1.d: "A demonstration of solidarity. A human chain was formed with about two million people forming a 500km human chain. Starting at the harbor at Keelung, Taiwan's northernmost city, the chain wended its way to the southernmost tip of the island. The purpose was dual in nature. The Taiwanese wished for peace, but they were also protesting the deployment of missiles by the People's Republic of China aimed at Taiwan, their island neighbor. Some of the symbolism of the demonstration, particularly at the point in the event where participants \"turn away from China\" veered clearly toward support of Taiwanese independence, and hence was not attended by members of the Pan-Blue Coalition who countered the demonstration with an island-wide rally of their own days later."
 taiwan.1.a: "Let us never forget the victims."
 taiwan.2.t: "Typhoon Bilis"
 taiwan.2.d: "In preparation for Bilis, offices were closed across the island. In addition to the closure of businesses, flights to and from the island were rescheduled, and a typhoon relief center was established. Due to the threat of landslides, a landslide warning was issued for Taiwan. Though the storm had not yet made landfall, one person was killed in Taipei on August 22 after they were buried by a landslide triggered by the impending typhoon; this accounted for the first fatality caused by Bilis. Along with flight rescheduling, numerous airports were closed, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange was set to close on August 23. Meanwhile, hospitals extended service times in anticipation for patient admittance. Taiwanese coast guard members regulated fishing activity due to the threat of deadly wave action. The Port of Kaohsiung was closed throughout the duration of the storm. Due to the heightened demand for vegetables in the lead-up to the storm, the cost of such foods increased by 20 to 30 percent.\n\nBilis was a highly destructive tropical cyclone for Taiwan. Damage to the island's agricultural, fishing, and forestry industries amounted to US$133.5 million. The typhoon caused 14 fatalities and injured an additional 80 people. Power outages adversely impacted approximately 600,000 households, and 400 homes across Taiwan were destroyed. Several hundred thousand families experienced water shortage following the storm. In Cheng-Kung, a weather station recorded a 281 km/h wind gust, which broke the station's anemometer. A single landslide in the town of Jenai buried nine farmers. Tens of thousands of people were displaced during the storm, and moved into evacuation shelters set up by the government. In eastern Hualien County, 250 houses succumbed to strong winds. The winds also felled trees and blew light vehicles around, blocking roads. Heavy rainfall associated with Bilis flooded roughly 40,000 ha of orchards and rice paddies. Following Bilis' passage of Taiwan, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the island, exacerbating the already worsened conditions."
 taiwan.2.a: "Time to rebuild."
 taiwan.3.t: "Taiwan presidential election"
 taiwan.3.d: "Its the second ever direct presidential election of the Republic of China, to elect the 10th-term President and Vice-President of the Republic of China under the 1947 Constitution. This has the potential to put an end to more than half a century of Kuomintang rule on Taiwan, since the KMT voters split in half.\n\nThough more popular and consistently ranked higher in the polls, the outspoken former Taiwan Governor James Soong failed to gain the Kuomintang's nomination. As a result, he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate. The Kuomintang responded by expelling Soong and 21 of his allies. They sued Soong for theft, alleging that as party Secretary-General, he stole millions of Taiwan dollars in cash intended for the family of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and hid the money in the Chunghsing Bills Finance Co. Soong defended himself by saying he was acting under Lee's direction, but his story was largely unpersuasive. Initially holding a commanding lead in the polls, Soong lost by just over 300,000 votes, and the financial scandal that tarnished his image as a clean politician will likely led to his failure.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party run former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian for president. Having run for the 1996 election on a radical independence platform and lost by a landslide, the DPP in May 1999 moderated its stance by issuing the \"Resolution on the Future of Taiwan.\" The resolution accepted the status quo and promoted the moderate view that Taiwan was already independent, so any formal declaration would not be urgently necessary, if at all. Also included was the pledge that any change in Taiwan's international status will have to be done through a referendum, thus alleviating the fear that, if elected, a DPP government would unilaterally declare independence without popular approval. The Chen-Lu ticket also promises to be more aggressive in fighting black gold, to provide more funding for social services, and to be more environmentally friendly, such as opposition to nuclear power."
 taiwan.3.a: "Chen Shui-bian (DPP)"
 taiwan.3.b: "Lien Chan (KMT)"

 taiwan.4.t: "Coast Guard Administration established"
 taiwan.4.d: "The CGA combines the Coast Guard Command, the Marine Police Bureau, and several cutters from the Taiwan Directorate General of Customs, Ministry of Finance. The CGA formally unifies coastal and maritime law enforcement agencies. It will see a great deal of action for a young agency, participating in numerous search and rescue and anti-smuggling operations in the near future.\n\nThe Coast Guard Administration of the Ocean Affairs Council (CGA) is charged with maintaining law and order, protecting the resources of the territorial waters of the ROC, which surrounds Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu Islands, Green Island, Orchid Island, Dongsha Islands, and Nansha Islands as well as providing a first line of defense along coastal areas against smugglers and illegal immigrants. The CGA is considered a civilian law enforcement agency under the administration of Ocean Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan, though during emergencies it may be incorporated as part of the Republic of China Armed Forces.\n\nThe Coast Guard Administration is headed by one minister and three deputy ministers. The CGA includes eight departments, one office and five task forces, as well as a Maritime Patrol Directorate General and a Coastal Patrol Directorate General. Its jurisdiction covers the waters surrounding Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu, and the main island of Taiwan to ensure proper protection of the 1,819.8 kilometers coastline and 540,000 square kilometers of \"Blue Territory,\" which is 15 times larger than the island of Taiwan."

Among these departments, Asia-Pacific Industrial and Business Management is especially designed for cultivating industrial elites.\n\nAn unusual feature in this school is its open space. There are no walls on the boundaries of the campus. Residents who live around this school can walk to campus or exercise by using equipment in the gym. Biodiversity is also a notable characteristic of NUK. There are more than 60 sorts of fish in pond of the Water Land Park."

 taiwan.10.t: "China Demands an End to the Taiwan Relations Act!"
 taiwan.10.d: "The PRC has demanded that we revoke the Taiwan Relations Act that enshrines our current relationship with the governing authorities of Taiwan.

[HKG.GetLeader] has stated that while the Hong Kong government respects the right of the Hong Kong people to peacefully and legally express their views, violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated. China's response to the current crisis remains to be seen, as [CHI.GetLeader] has not commented on recent events."
 hongkong_news.1.d_limit: "Following China's decision that the Chief Executive of Hong Kong could only be elected by universal suffrage if it pre-approves the candidates, mass protests have broken out in the Chinese territory. [HKG.GetLeader] has stated that while the Hong Kong government respects the right of the Hong Kong people to peacefully and legally express their views, violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated. China's response to the current crisis remains to be seen, as [CHI.GetLeader] has not commented on recent events."
 hongkong_news.1.d_reunification: "Following China's announcement that in 2047 Hong Kong will lose its special status and return to Chinese control completely, mass protests have broken out in the Chinese territory. [HKG.GetLeader] has stated that while the Hong Kong government respects the right of the Hong Kong people to peacefully and legally express their views, violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated.

 hongkong_news.1.d_annexed: "Following China's heavily controversial annexation of Hong Kong, mass protests have broken out in the Chinese territory. [HKG.GetLeader] has stated that while the Hong Kong government respects the right of the Hong Kong people to peacefully and legally express their views, violence and lawlessness will not be tolerated. China's response to the current crisis remains to be seen, as [CHI.GetLeader] has not commented on recent events."
 hongkong_news.1.a: "An interesting development."
 hongkong_news.1.b: "This is bad news for us."

 hongkong_news.2.t: "Hong Kong Protests Fizzle Out"
 hongkong_news.2.d: "Protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region against recent Chinese actions have gradually declined in recent days and have virtually come to a stop. Police operations in the Chinese territory have met with no resistance, and many who had previously taken to the streets have returned to their homes. What this means for the relationship between China and a troubled territory that holds significant different political values from the former remain to be seen. Perhaps one indicator for what is to come was a banner left by protesters in a prominent location in the city center which read \"We will be back\"."
 hongkong_news.2.a: "An interesting development."
 hongkong_news.2.b: "They know their cause is futile."

 hongkong_news.3.t: "Hong Kong Protests Increase in Scale"
 hongkong_news.3.d: "Protests against Chinese actions in the territory of Hong Kong have rapidly increased, with analysts widely agreeing that the protests have entered a new stage in terms of scale and tactics. How the Chinese and Hong Kong governments will respond to this new escalation remains to be seen, but officials in both governments are reportedly increasingly resentful of the impacts of the protests on their vested interests. The protesters, for their part, are refusing to stand down until the Chinese and Hong Kong governments address their demands."
 hongkong_news.3.a: "The Hong Kong people will not stay quiet..."
 hongkong_news.3.b: "They will stay home if they know what's good for them!"

 #Korea
 korea.1.t: "China Demands Our Withdrawal from the Korean Peninsula"
 korea.1.d: "The PRC has demanded that we withdraw our troops protecting the Republic of Korea from what it describes as its \"sphere of influence\". This demand is undoubtedly a prelude to aggressive action towards the ROK. If we pull our troops out of the Peninsula, the chances of a conflict across the DMZ will rise dramatically."
 korea.1.a: "This demand is ludicrous!"
 korea.1.b: "It is better for us to concede..."

 korea.2.t: "China is encouraging us to initiate economic reforms"
 korea.2.d: "[CHI.GetLeader] is urging our government to follow China's lead and initiate market liberalization reforms. While experiencing the same rapid economic growth as China did in the 1980s is a tempting proposition, we should weigh this against the instability that would inevitably result from our pursuit of such reforms."
 korea.2.a: "Now is not the time for reform!"
 korea.2.b: "Initiate minor reforms."
 korea.2.c: "Initiate moderate reforms."
 korea.2.e: "Initiate major reforms."

 korea.3.t: "[NKO.GetLeader] has announced fresh economic reforms"
 korea.3.d: "Under Chinese pressure to reform, North Korea has begun a process of economic liberalization that many hope will raise living standards in the \"hermit kingdom\". While many economists have lauded the beginning of this reform process, others have raised concerns about whether the speed of reform may cause instability in a country that has become adjusted to a completely planned economy."
 korea.3.a: "Encouraging news?"

 korea.4.t: "The Chinese-North Korean Split"
 korea.4.d: "Criticisms of [NKO.GetLeader]'s regime in Chinese government-linked media have increased dramatically in recent weeks. These criticisms have attacked North Korea's continued nuclear problem and the North Korean state's failure to improve the livelihoods of its citizens through economic liberalization as China has done in recent decades.\n\nWhile [CHI.GetLeader] has remained silent on the issue, it is widely believed that these media organizations would not have launched such a scathing critique of a once close ally without [CHI.GetLeader]'s tacit approval. Many observers see this as a culmination of Chinese frustration with the Kim dynasty, and possibly a desire for the establishment of an alternative government that is more stable and compliant with China's wishes."
 korea.4.a: "Only [CHI.GetLeader] knows where this going..."

 korea.5.t: "The Talks Begin"
 korea.5.d: "The primary demand of the North is that we cease our joint military exercises with the United States, exercises that they see as preparations for an invasion of their territory. However, these exercises are widely viewed by our military as necessary preparations in case of a North Korean attack. Agreeing to stop these exercises would therefore be a significant gamble, one where our country's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.d_NKO: "The primary demand of the South is that we cease our nuclear weapons tests, tests that they see as evidence of our aggressive intentions. However, our nuclear weapons program is viewed by the military as an important deterrent against US invasion. Moreover, the program and the tests that are necessary for its continuation help bolster the legitimacy of our government. Agreeing to stop these tests would therefore be a significant gamble, one where both our country and our government's security is put on the line."
 korea.5.a: "Our country will never be whole again unless we take a few risks..."
 korea.5.b: "Some risks are too big too take."

 korea.6.t: "Korean Peace Talks Begin"
 korea.6.d: "For over half a century North and South Korea have technically been in a state of war. This frozen conflict has occasionally heated up with clashes between the two sides along disputed maritime boundaries or across the DMZ. Now the two sides are coming together in the hope of bringing about an end to this state of affairs and achieve de-escalation on the Korean peninsula through a formal peace treaty. Negotiating a peace treaty is widely seen as an important first step towards reunifying the Korean peninsula."
 korea.6.a: "Can the two sides reach a compromise?"

 korea.7.t: "[CHI.GetLeader] Voices Support for Korean Reunification"
 korea.7.d: "China has historically been wary of the prospect of a united Korea aligned with the United States on its doorstep. Observers were therefore surprised to hear [CHI.GetLeader] voice unequivocal support for reunification, in a move that by some accounts has caught the North Korean leadership off guard. Given China's substantial influence in the Korean Peninsula, this announcement is likely to pressure the two sides to come to the negotiation table."
 korea.7.a: "Is change in the air?"


 korea.38.t: "Russia is encouraging us to initiate economic reforms"
 korea.38.d: "[SOV.GetLeader] is urging our government to initiate western market liberalization reforms. While experiencing the same rapid economic growth as China did in the 1980s is a tempting proposition, we should weigh this against the instability that would inevitably result from our pursuit of such reforms."
 korea.38.a: "Now is not the time for reform!"
 korea.38.b: "Initiate minor reforms."
 korea.38.c: "Initiate moderate reforms."
 korea.38.e: "Initiate major reforms."
 #Cyber Warfare

 cyber.4.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Hackers have Failed to Breach our Defences!"

 cyber.5.t: "We have successfully targeted Taiwanese citizens with our propaganda!"
 cyber.5.d: "Now that we have managed to infiltrate social media websites and forums used by people from this country, we can choose whether we wish to use this propaganda to increase our influence in the country or to manipulate the country's politics."

 recognition.4.a: "Our nation will be whole again!"

 recognition.5.t: "[FROM.GetName] Recognizes the Legitimacy of Our Government!"
 recognition.5.d: "No doubt in recognition of our right to represent our people, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has cut off ties with our rival and established ties with our government. This represents a significant step forward in the struggle against our rivals to represent the voice of our people in the international arena."
 recognition.5.a: "Our enemies grow weaker!"

 recognition.6.t: "[FROM.GetName] No Longer Recognizes Our Government!"
 recognition.6.d: "A blow to our international position has been dealt by the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] against the wishes of our people. The [FROM.GetAdjective] have regrettably chosen to recognize an illegitimate rival government over ourselves, a decision that they will hopefully revoke as soon as possible."

 internal_faction.2.t: "Some Communist Party Cadres are Engaged in Corrupt Activities!"

 internal_faction.3.t: "Industrial Conglomerates are Requesting Tax Breaks"

 Kurdistan.5.d: "Due to the success of the Kurdish Independence Referendum, the Kurdish government is trying to use the referendum as leverage to demand more autonomy from the control of the Federal Government. It seems that they aren't happy with just limited autonomy, and they still hold Kirkuk, which is rightfully part of Iraq."
 Kurdistan.5.a: "Absolutely not!"
 Kurdistan.5.b: "Yes, if they give us back Kirkuk."
 Kurdistan.5.c: "Agree to their demands."
 Kurdistan.6.t: "Iraq Agrees to Demands"
 Kurdistan.6.d: "The Iraqi Federal Government has agreed to our demands!"
 Kurdistan.6.a: "Huzzah!"
 Kurdistan.7.t: "Iraq Demands Kirkuk"
 Kurdistan.7.d: "In a response to our demands, the Iraqi Government has stated that they will agree to our demands, but in exchange they want us to give them back control the city of Kirkuk, which they see as rightfully theirs."
 Kurdistan.7.a: "A fitting price."
 Kurdistan.7.b: "Kirkuk is Kurdish land!"
 Kurdistan.8.t: "Kurdistan Refuses"
 Kurdistan.8.d: "Kurdistan has refused to give us back Kirkuk. Let us hope that they change their mind about their ideals of sovereignty"
 Kurdistan.8.a: "Damn!"
 Kurdistan.9.t: "Future of Kurdistan"
 Kurdistan.9.d: "Now that the negotiations with Iraq have broken down, we need to determine a path for our nation. We could start pursuing full independence, which will most likely upset Iraq. On the other hand, we bury our ideas of independence and return to be governed by the Iraqi Federal Government."
 Kurdistan.9.a: "Kurdistan is a free nation!"
 Kurdistan.9.b: "Beg for forgiveness."
 Kurdistan.10.t: "Kurdistan Declares Independence"
 Kurdistan.10.d: "The Kurdish government announced today that Kurdistan is an independent country, and not part of Iraq. This is a serious blowback to the Iraqi nation, and the Kurdish forces still control the vital city of Kirkuk. Some politicans and generals are arguing that a show of force is necessary. We need to order our troops to occupy Kirkuk, and show the Kurds our willingness to defend Iraqi lands"
 Kurdistan.10.a: "Prepare an attack on Kirkuk!"
 Kurdistan.10.b: "We don't want to start a war."
 Kurdistan.11.t: "Iraq Moves Against Kirkuk!"
 Kurdistan.11.d: "After we declared independence, we've received reports that Iraqi forces are readying for an attack against Kirkuk. Defending against well equipped and combat-experienced Iraqi troops will be difficult, and losing the battle will be a loss of face for us. On the other hand, a possible victory might scare the Iraqis off. We could also just retreat from the city to avoid bloodshed."
 Kurdistan.11.a: "Make a stand!"
 Kurdistan.11.b: "Retreat!"
 Kurdistan.13.t: "Fate of Kurdistan"
 Kurdistan.13.d: "Now that we have taken control of Kirkuk, the Kurds have no choice but to submit to us, or face even worse consequences"
 Kurdistan.13.a: "Demand their submission."
 Kurdistan.14.t: "Iraq Demands Submission"
 Kurdistan.14.d: "After the defeat and loss of Kirkuk, the Iraqi government has gotten more air under its wings. They are now demanding that we abandon our future plans and submit back under their rule"
 Kurdistan.14.a: "Submit."
 Kurdistan.14.b: "Resist."
 Kurdistan.15.t: "Kurdistan Submits"
 Kurdistan.15.d: "Kurdistan has agreed to rejoin us!"
 Kurdistan.15.a: "Great."
 Kurdistan.16.t: "Kurdistan Resists"
 Kurdistan.16.d: "Kurdistan has refused our demands of subjugation"
 Kurdistan.16.a: "I guess we'll do this the hard way then."
 Kurdistan.17.t: "Failure at Kirkuk"
 Kurdistan.17.d: "Losing the Battle of Kirkuk was a disgrace. The Kurds still control the city, and we are humiliated. Should we still try to pursue unification?"
 Kurdistan.17.a: "We'll try again, this time bigger."
 Kurdistan.17.b: "Leave the Kurds alone."
 #News
 KurdistanNews.1.t: "Kurdistan Rejoins Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.1.d: "During the apex of ISIS, Kurdistan started slowly shifting away from Iraq and becoming more independent. Now that ISIS has been defeated, the Kurdistan Regional Government seems to have made a full turn and expressed wishes to start working again together with the Iraqi federal government. Many speculated that the Kurds would be aiming for independence, but it seems they've decided to decide otherwise, possibly fearing repercussions from their neighbours."
 KurdistanNews.1.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.2.t: "The Kurdish Independence Referendum"
 KurdistanNews.2.d: "The Kurdish Regional Government has announced that it will be holding an independence referendum in the areas that they currently control. The move has been seen as controversial, given that the referendum is being held in areas that aren't officially part of the Kurdish Autonomous Region but the Federal State of Iraq, including the major city of Kirkuk.\n\nMany see this as nothing more than a land-grab by the Kurds, while others argue that the Kurds have earned their right to independence after effectively saving Iraq from ISIS. Even though the KRG claims that the results will be non-binding, many fear that it will lead to full independence and possibly a new conflict in Iraq."
 KurdistanNews.2.a: "They have no right to do this!"
 KurdistanNews.2.b: "Let's see how this play out."
 KurdistanNews.3.t: "Kurdish Independence Referendum Succeeds"
 KurdistanNews.3.d: "The Kurdish Independence Referendum was a resounding success for the Kurdish government. With a 93% vote of 'Yes' option with a 72% voter turnout, Kurdish people everywhere rejoice. Due to the success of the referendum, the Kurdish government decided to declare full independence from the Iraqi Federal Government. Surprisingly, the Iraqi government agreed to the request."

 KurdistanNews.5.t: "Iraq Captures Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.5.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached Kirkuk, most elements of the Peshmerga retreated from the city without a fight. Some independent elements of the Kurdish forces stayed and tried to set up a defence of the city, but were quickly overwhelmed by the Iraqis. In just two days, the Iraqi forces had regained full control of the city, most of it without any fighting."
 KurdistanNews.5.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.6.t: "Iraq Captures Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.6.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached the city, Kurdish forces took up defensive positions, with main defenses being at the K1 military base and the Kirkuk-Takrit Road.\n\nDespite strong defence, the Iraqi 9th Armoured Division managed capture the military base and advance towards the Northern oil field of Baba Gurgur, while the Popular Mobilisation Forces tied down Kurdish troops in the city itself. Fearing encirclement, the Kurdish forces started retreating from the city, some under orders and some on their own. After a few days of fighting, Iraq was fully in control of the city."
 KurdistanNews.6.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.7.t: "Kurdistan Defends Kirkuk"
 KurdistanNews.7.d: "As the negotiations between Iraq and Kurdistan broke down, Iraqi forces moved to capture the city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds had captured from ISIS earlier. As the Iraqi forces approached the city, Kurdish forces took up defensive positions, with main defenses being at the K1 military base and the Kirkuk-Takrit Road.\n\nIraqi 9th Armoured Division split their forces in two, as they attacked both the military base and the city itself through its Southern suburbs. At the same time, the Popular Mobilisation Forces attacked in the centre towards Kirkuk Airfield. As the 9th Armoured Division got bogged down in the suburbs, the Kurdish forces managed to conduct a flanking attack against the PMF forces, forcing them to retreat. With the centre destroyed, the separated elements of the 9th Armoured Division were soon forced to retreat as well. The Battle of Kirkuk proved to be disastrous for the Iraqi forces, while the morale of the Kurds was greatly boosted."
 KurdistanNews.7.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.8.t: "Kurdistan Submits to Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.8.d: "After their victory in Kirkuk, Iraq has increased pressure towards Kurdistan.

 KurdistanNews.8.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.9.t: "Kurdistan Resists Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.9.d: "After their victory in Kirkuk, Iraq has increased pressure towards Kurdistan. In a recent move, Iraq demanded that Kurdistan abandon all ideas of independence or increased autonomy. The Kurdish government responded that Iraq has already shown its hostility against the Kurdish people, and at such they have no reason to agree to the demands of bullies. This might spark a new civil war in Iraq"
 KurdistanNews.9.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.10.t: "Iraq Moves Against Kurdistan"
 KurdistanNews.10.d: "The defeat at Kirkuk was a massive humiliation to Iraq. As a response to this, it seems they are preparing for a full-scale invasion of Kurdistan in order to bring back the breakaway state back under Iraqi control."
 KurdistanNews.10.a: "Interesting."
 KurdistanNews.11.t: "Iraq Withdraws into Isolation"
 KurdistanNews.11.d: "The defeat at Kirkuk was a massive humiliation to Iraq. It seems that the defeat completely demotivated Iraq from any hostility towards the Kurds. The Kurds have won their demands through blood."
 KurdistanNews.11.a: "Interesting."

 #Yemeni Events

 Yemen.4.t: "The War in Yemen has Ended"
 Yemen.4.d: "With the country in ruin, the Yemeni Civil War has finally concluded, granting victory to the Hadi-led government, backed by the Saudi Coalition. In the final days of the conflict, coalition forces managed to capture and destroy Houthi and Al-Qaeda ammo dumps, including the infamous Burkan 2-H scud missiles. Though many may still hold their loyalties to the Houthis, they have been disarmed, and in the coming days, the remaining Zaydi radicals will be rooted out and dealt with. Democracy has prevailed in the region with the help of the Saudi coalition and it's campaign, Restoring Hope, and the country of Yemen is on it's way to being rebuilt."
 Yemen.4.d2: "With the Hadi-led government reduced to rubble, the Houthi cause has found itself at the forefront of Yemen's future leadership. As was their goal, the Houthi's have managed to drive salafism and devotion to western ideologies from the region, and those who fought for it, as the Al-Qaeda and coalition forces lie in ruin. Now with the full responsibility of leading Yemen into the future, the Houthi government has begun the process of transforming from it's interrim state, and they have now embarked on the path of rebuilding the country. The Saudi coalition has withdrawn from the region, and has rendered Operation Restoring Hope, a complete and utter failure."
 Yemen.4.d3: "After years of fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, the most unlikely of all victors has emerged from the conflict. The remnants of Al-Qaeda in Yemen have found themselves as the architect of a new caliphate in the region, and have undergone a transformation for the future that will put all infidels in the region in danger. The Saudi coalition and Operation Restoring Hope has been a complete failure, and it's incompetence has failed to predict it's own defeat to an enemy it never new was this serious. The Jihadis have prevailed, and they have made it clear that this is only the beginning, and the rest of the world will soon realize what this new caliphate can do."
 Yemen.4.a: "Victory is finally ours..."
 Yemen.4.b: "But at what cost?"
 Yemen.4.c: "It could have been worse..."
 Yemen.4.e: "Interesting."
 Yemen.4.f: "Interesting."

 Yemen.6.t: "Fire missile at Riyadh?"
 Yemen.6.d: "Shooting a missile at the Saudi Capital will show the Saudis we're a force to be reckoned with."
 Yemen.6.a: "Do it!"
 Yemen.6.b: "Too dangerous."

 Yemen.7.t: "Houthis fire ballistic missile at Riyadh"
 Yemen.7.d: "Saudi-led coalition battling Yemen's Houthi rebels says it has intercepted a missile fired from the neighbouring country towards the kingdom's capital, Riyadh. Houthi rebels said on Tuesday they had launched a ballistic missile targeting al-Yamama royal palace to mark 1,000 days since the coalition started its bombing campaign in Yemen."
 Yemen.7.a: "Uh oh..."

 Saleh.1.t: "The Houthi Power Struggle"
 Saleh.1.d: "The unlikely alliance between the Houthi rebels and Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress, has been on shaky ground since the day it was conceived. With help from our coalition members operating inside Yemen, we've discovered that former President Saleh has a growing discontent for the Houthi leadership, and rightly so. The Houthis oppose being effectively controlled by foreign powers, and seek to restore Yemen as it's own, completely independent entity free of salafism and western ideals. Saleh on the other hand, wants to restore Yemen as a free, united and democratic country, eager to participate in foreign affairs to an extent, though he does have his reasons to resent a number of western nations. This relationship is bound to boil over into a future conflict between the two parties, and it may be what the coalition needs."
 Saleh.1.a: "We don't have time for this..."
 Saleh.1.b: "Get President Saleh on the phone..."

 Saleh.2.t: "Saleh Suggests Coalition Dialogue"
 Saleh.2.d: "Ali Abdullah Saleh, the head of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi cause, is suggesting that the GPC and Houthi leadership open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition currently operating alongside President Hadi's Yemen. Though we very narrowly consider him an ally, it appears he has had a change of heart, and not in a good way. He now sternly suggests that the Houthi leadership come to a decision on whether or not this brutal civil war should continue. The likelihood of us coming out of these talks with something to gain is very small, and it could all very well be a ploy to remove us from power."
 Saleh.2.a: "Absolutely not!"
 Saleh.2.b: "It couldn't hurt..."

 Saleh.3.t: "Houthi Leaders are Willing to Talk"
 Saleh.3.d: "After pressure from the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the leaders of the Houthi insurgents in Sana'a are willing to try to come to terms with Hadi and our coalition."
 Saleh.3.a: "Well then, gather the coalition."
 Saleh.3.b: "This probably isn't a good idea..."

 Saleh.5.t: "Saleh Embarks on a Dangerous Path"
 Saleh.5.d: "After years of an indecisive and unstable alliance between Houthi and Republican forces, former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, held a speech directed at the Saudi-led coalition highlighting the so-called stupidity of the Houthi cause. Saleh stated that if the coalition were to lift their blockade and open the airports to ease the humanitarian effort, him and his republican forces were willing to pledge their allegiance to Saudi Arabia, declaring himself an enemy of our alliance. Saleh appeared fully committed in his most recent speech, and publicly declared a new chapter in Yemen's history amidst this humanitarian crisis, as a united, free and democratic Yemen. The words of Saleh - I am going to fight the enemies of humanity and the enemies of our homeland who are trying hard to erase its identity and destroy its gains and humiliate the Yemenis!"
 Saleh.5.a: "Find this traitor..."
 Saleh.5.b: "He doesn't have the guts to do it..."

 Saleh.6.t: "Saleh is On The Run"
 Saleh.6.d: "After giving a series of treacherous speeches, Ali Abdullah Saleh has made it clear he no longer wishes to work alongside the Houthis. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi knew of Saleh's approaching treachery, and he issued several warnings to him, all of which were not heeded. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi declared this as a treasonous act, which subsequently led to Saleh's home in Sana'a being destroyed by Houthi mortar fire, and he is now fleeing the country. Houthi fighters have been hot on his trail, and they've managed to drive him into a potentially fatal trap south of Sana'a, where combat between the Houthi's and the coalition still rages. A number of fighters manning the front are prepared to pull back and intervene on your command."
 Saleh.6.a: "Pull the trigger..."
 Saleh.6.b: "Let him go..."

 Saleh.7.t: "The Supreme Political Council"
 Saleh.7.d: "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot foresee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
 Saleh.7.a: "We fought to achieve this position, and we will fight to defend it."
 Saleh.7.b: "Nonsense, we will rebuild our nation together."

 Saleh.8.t: "Houthi Leadership Denies Saleh's Suggestion"
 Saleh.8.d: "After our talk with former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, he made an effort to convince the Houthi leadership to come to a conclusion on whether or not this war of theirs should continue. As we expected, he was rejected without a second thought. The Houthis appear to be beyond adamant on the topic of continuing their war effort to overthrow the democratic government of Yemen. This has worn on on the alliance between Saleh's General People's Congress and the Houthi rebels, and if we push Saleh harder, he may be willing to finally severe ties with the misguided cause."
 Saleh.8.a: "We must try harder!"
 Saleh.8.b: "Forget it..."

 Saleh.9.t: "Saleh Persists"
 Saleh.9.d: "Ali Abdullah Saleh once again, suggests that we open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition, who I must remind you, is our enemy. It is true that our alliance with the GPC has always been in a critical state, but this persistence by Saleh has not appeared out of thin air, he must have a motive. It would not be crazy to believe that the Saudi-led coalition is in contact with him, we must watch this closely."
 Saleh.9.a: "This might actually be a good idea..."
 Saleh.9.b: "Ali, stop this immediately, or else."
 Saleh.9.c: "Mr. Saleh, may I have a word with you?"

 HOU_Saleh.1: "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be pursued by Houthi fighters."
 HOU_Saleh.2: "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be contacted about bringing the Yemeni Civil War to an end, with our help. Whether that be through diplomacy or brute force, we must convince him to attend a dialogue with our coalition."
 HOU_Saleh.3: "Our alliance has never been as strong as would be ideal, but I do value our allegiance, though it may not seem this way. I understand that you want a conclusion to this war, but unfortunately I cannot allow myself or my comrades to deal with this devil of a coalition. Surely you understand?"
 HOU_Saleh.4: "Ali is disappointed."
 HOU_Saleh.5: "Ali will be contacted once more."
 HOU_Saleh.6: "Ali visibly recoils, and exits the room."
 HOU_Saleh.7: "Ali will be contacted again, but let this be the final warning to him that if he remains aligned with our enemy, he too will be treated as an enemy."

 Saleh.10.t: "Saleh is Wasting Our Time..."
 Saleh.10.d: "Once again, the leader of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi rebels,  Ali Abdullah Saleh, was denied by the Houthi leadership to commence peace talks with our coalition. It has been clear from the beginning that the Houthi leadership will not speak with us, as they see us as a sworn enemy. With the GPC-Houthi alliance as critical as it is, we must deliver Ali Abdullah Saleh an ultimatum immediately. Without him, the Houthis governing parties will be in shambles without proper skill and talent behind it. With him, the leadership has competence, though it lacks a certain ability when it comes to progress, but it could potentially carry the Houthis to victory."
 Saleh.10.a: "He either takes action, or we cannot guarantee his safety."
 Saleh.10.b: "This is pointless..."

 Saleh.11.t: "The General People's Congress Defects!"
 Saleh.11.d: "Even after numerous occasions in which Saleh's Republican forces have exchanged fire with ours, we've formally remained allies. No longer, these traitors have officially declared themselves as our enemy after their treasonous leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was rightfully disposed of. The GPC and it's troops are actively engaging in firefights with us in the streets of our cities, we must put a stop to this at once."
 Saleh.11.a: "Traitors! I should have seen this coming!"

 Saleh.12.t: "Former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh Assassinated!"
 Saleh.12.d: "This day is considered a major victory for the Houthi cause, as the man who sought to tear them apart from the inside, has now been defeated. It was long believed by the Houthis that Saleh had been in contact with the Saudi-led coalition, but it wasn't until recently that Mr. Saleh had shown his true colors to the Houthis, and attempted to side with the coalition by declaring a new chapter of unification and democracy in Yemen. This struck a great ire in the Houthis, and with Saleh gone, they claim that their morale is soaring."
 Saleh.12.a: "Good work boys."
 Saleh.12.b: "This is troubling..."
 Saleh.12.c: "Interesting."

 Saleh.13.t: "Saleh Renews GPC-Houthi Alliance"
 Saleh.13.d: "The leader of the General People's Congress, a long-time Houthi ally, though not on the greatest of terms, has declared a renewal of the once divided alliance. Ali Abdullah Saleh publically announced a new chapter in Yemen's future, a chapter in which the GPC and Houthis will work together to restore the ruined nation. Saleh gave one condition, and that was that the Houthi leadership formalizes the Supreme Political Council, an interim government put in place in the time of war, and split the rulership between the two alliances, as was originally planned."
 Saleh.13.a: "Is this good? I can't tell."
 Saleh.13.b: "Damn!"

 Saleh.14.t: "The Coalition Gathers"
 Saleh.14.d: "The Houthi leadership opposing the democratic, Hadi-led government in Yemen, has shown that they are willing to come to the table and talk about the humanitarian situation currently ongoing in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition operating in Yemen, has invited all of it's members to a diplomatic summit being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The special guests will be Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi himself, along with his associate, Ali Abdullah Saleh."
 Saleh.14.a: "We must attend."
 Saleh.14.b: "Sorry, we don't have time for this."
 Saleh.14.c: "We would be honoured to host this summit."

 Saleh.15.t: "The Summit Commences"
 Saleh.15.d: "Those that chose to attend that summit take their seats, and await the beginning of the discussion. The Houthis have mentioned that they are not coming into this discussion with the intent to just surrender, so we must sway them to see the conflict from an outsider's shoes. This war in Yemen has been one of the greatest humanitarian crises in recent memory, and it would benefit all parties for the war to be put to a halt as soon as possible. To make this quick, let us share our demands..."
 Saleh.15.a: "Surrender and return all territories to Yemen's rightful government."
 Saleh.15.b: "Cease the conflict immediately, and both states shall remain independent."
 Saleh.15.c: "All Houthi claimed land shall be declared an Arabian state."

 Saleh.16.t: "The Coalition Demands Surrender"
 Saleh.16.d: "We were invited to this summit in Abu Dhabi to discuss a potential end to the war we have been fighting for years now, and we have come to the realization that this was all a waste of time. We were immediately greeted by an absurd demand as soon as the summit had started, that demand being our full surrender. But, as long as the war still rages, people will continue to die and cities will continue to be destroyed. Ending the war may be for the better, but it would mean capitulating to our sworn enemies."
 Saleh.16.a: "This war must end, so we must oblige."
 Saleh.16.b: "Ridiculous! This discussion ends now!"

 Saleh.17.t: "The Coalition Demands both States Remain Independent"
 Saleh.17.d: ""
 Saleh.17.a: "All of Yemen is ours, or this discussion is over."

 #Central African Republic
 CentralAfricaNews.1.t: "Central African Republic Civil War Over"
 CentralAfricaNews.1.CAR.d: "The legitimate government of [CAR.GetNameDef] under [CAR.GetLeader] has managed to pacify the fringes of the country.\n\nAfter being cornered in the capital as the rest of the country fell under various militias and factions, with international support the government was able to eventually expand the rule of law back into the country. Even though the worst violence is behind them, the government will still have to work hard to remove all sectarian violence from the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.SEL.d: "The Seleka coalition in Central Africa has secured control of the country.\n\nThe origins of the group is in 2003, when it was formed to combat Michael Bozize's coup. After the Seleka leader Michel Djotodia was made president in 2013, the group was officially disbanded. This caused the ex-fighters to go on a reign of terror in the country, igniting the civil war.\n\nDespite being predominantly Muslim (thus representing only a tenth of the population), the group still has managed to once again gain control of the country. This will most likely create another wave of terror on the predominantly Christian population of the country."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.BAL.d: "The Anti-Balaka alliance in Central Africa has gained control of the country.\n\nWhat started as a Christian militia to protect from highwaymen in the 90s, turned into an official self-protection group in 2009. The group's main purpose was to fight against the Seleka militias, who were predominantly Muslim. Like their enemies, they quickly adopted violent tactics, force converting, burning and mass executing Muslims in the country.\n\nThe group is now in full control of the country, and future prospects for the small Muslim minority are looking bleak."
 CentralAfricaNews.1.LOG.d: "The Republic of Dar El Kuti, also known as the Republic of Logone, has subjugated the Central African government and the various militias roaming the country.\n\nCalling for independence for the Muslims of the country, Dar El Kuti has practically split the country in two. This might only be a short period for peace however, as many Christians still live in the new republic's borders."

 SomaliaNews.0.t: "Somalian Government Toppled!"
 SomaliaNews.0.d: "The Al-Shabaab militants have manged to overcome the Somalian governmental forces and their allies.\n\nThe conflict between the Somali government and Al-Shabaab escalated in 2009, after the Transitional Federal Government accepted hundreds of moderate Islamists into the parliament. This greatly upset the non-secular leadership of Al-Shabaab.\n\nDespite being driven to near defeat in 2017, the Islamist group managed to bounce back and gather support from various smaller Islamist and tribal factions, many of which were displeased with the Western-backed secular government. The Black Standard now flies over Mogadishu, and the Al-Shabaab are free to continue spreading radical Islam"
 SomaliaNews.0.a: "Horrible!"
 SomaliaNews.0.b: "Allahu Akbar!"
 SomaliaNews.1.t: "Al-Shabaab Defeated!"
 SomaliaNews.1.d: "The Somalian governmental forces have managed to capture the last remaining stronghold of the Islamist Al-Shabaab. Ever since the ignition of sectarian violence in 2009, the Somalian government along with its African Union allies have been fighting Al-Shabaab. Already a cornered animal by 2017, the last remaining pockets of Al-Shabaab were slowly but surely destroyed by Somalian and AMISOM forces.\n\n'Small pockets of resistance and individual terror cells still remain but they will not be a threat to the Somali government', a government spokesperson said."

 SomaliaNews.2.SNA.d: "The Somali National Alliance has managed to claim rulership over Somalia against the UN-backed Transitional National Government. [SNA.GetLeader], son of late general Mohammed Aidid, has been nominated the new president of the Republic. The fight between SNA and TNG originated from SNA's claims that the TNG was 'harboring militant Islamist sympathizers'. The new government will likely clamp down hard on the more radical elements of Somali society."
 SomaliaNews.2.Separatist.d: "The nation of Somalia delves into chaos, as various separatist groups claim victory over the government. Despite Somalia being an ethnically homogeneous country, clan traditions still rule strong and offer a stronger sense of identity than nationality. Several clans have declared self-rule, and a unified Somali Republic seems nothing more than a distant dream now."

 european_union.2.t: "We have been vetoed!"

 european_union.4.d: "The European Union in the past has done everything to drive its member states closer to each other. It guaranteed us peace, economic prosperity and greater freedom for our citizens. But now, the EU is asking us to do the next step: One of the countries has initiated the process to Unite the EU."

 european_union.10.d2: "The European Union holds us and our fellow sovereign European states back from greatness. The members of our government grow increasingly upset with the European attitude towards our national sovereignty and the ease with which European delegates do whatever the United States tells them to do.\n\nWe need to quit. This is unacceptable. They can kiss American asses all they want, but they will have to do that without us."
 european_union.10.d3: "While monarchies are not technically banned from joining the European Union, they have to have petty little things like parliaments or elections - which the grand system around [This.GetLeader] thankfully is devoid of. This however has lead to a precarious spot for us, being asked to either hold general elections within the next week or be expelled from the halls.\n\nWell, we won't hold elections, that much is certain, so it seems they will have to play their little 'democracy' game without us."
 european_union.10.d4: "With a right-wing political party now in power, the democratic character and economic benefit of the European Union has been increasingly called into question.\n\nThe [This.GetRulingParty] delegates are split on the issue: The ideological hardliners want to leave the union no matter the consequences, while the economically liberal faction points to the number of jobs created by the EU and the political stability it brings to the continent.\n\nAny decision will be controversial, as the populous is split on the issue. Will the EU carry on without us - or should we stay?"
 european_union.10.d5: "The European Union is nothing but a bunch of capitalists that try to conquer the world for capitalism. Our brave [This.GetAdjective] delegates have stood up for the working people in every session they attended, but they are outvoted on almost any issue - when asking to disown the super rich across Europe, the delegation was even kicked from the hall! Well, maybe they should not have attacked three other delegations while their speaker was trying to argue with them, but still!\n\nThis is completely unacceptable. We can no longer carry this farce of a conglomerate. Without us!"
 european_union.10.d6: "Even [This.GetLeader] has remarked that the European Union is really 'nothing but a bunch of infidels' when talking to a conservative Islamic newspaper last week. Because of this, calls to leave the EU have gotten louder the country over - and inside the European Union. 'If you don't respect our holy halls, leave!', the president of the European Parliament shouted at our delegation today. After one of our delegates remarked that there is nothing holy except for Allah, he was kicked from the hall.\n\nThe EU has run its course for our nation. We are thankful for their cooperation, but their hedonism and worldly intrigue is unacceptable. They will have to play their stupid games without us."

 european_union.10.o2: "Maybe we should stay after all."
 european_union.15.t: "The End of the European Union"

 european_union.15.o1: "Everything comes to an end."
 european_union.16.t: "The Euro"
 european_union.16.d: "Plans for a common European currency have been around since the foundation of the European Union in 1992.\nThe project comes to fruition ten years later, with the creation of the Euro, guided by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nGiving up national authority over our currency might have downsides, but the economic benefits of trading with our neighbors and partners might just outweigh them.\nBritish, Danish and Swedish delegations have already voiced concerns and demanded a possibility of an opt-out for their respective country; which is why they refused to participate in the initial digital introduction of the Euro in 1999. What should our policy be?"
 european_union.16.o1: "An excellent proposal!"
 european_union.16.o2: "We want an opt-out."
 european_union.17.t: "Re-Nationalize the Currency"
 european_union.17.d: "Now that we are no longer involved with the Eurozone, we have - as expected - been informed by the European Central Bank that we need to soon shift the Euro out of use in our country.\n\nIntroducing a new national currency will take quite a bit of political effort - but it has to be done."
 european_union.17.o1: "Let's get it over with."
 european_union.18.t: "Call EU military aid?"
 european_union.18.d: "We are under attack by a foreign power. As according to the EU article 42.7 - the 'mutual defense clause' - we are entitled to military assistance from all other European Union members. Should we invoke the article to call our friends to our side?"
 european_union.18.o1: "Call the EU to our side!"
 european_union.18.o2: "We don't need them."
 european_union.19.t: "[From.GetName] is in need of assistance!"
 european_union.19.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] has invoked EU article 42.7 due to the recent [From.From.GetAdjective] attack, under which all European Union members are required to come to each other's aid in the terms of military attack by a foreign force.\n\nThere is no doubt that we need to join our allies as according to the treaties we signed - but should we?"

 LibyaNews.1.t: "Second Libyan Civil War Comes to an End"
 LibyaNews.1.GNA.d: "The Second Libyan Civil War started in 2014, after the Libyan military under General Khalifa Haftar ousted the ruling government when they refused to step down after losing the elections of 2014. The supporters of the government formed a new faction, the National Salvation Government, sparking a new civil war. In 2015, the UN brokered a truce between the two factions, forming a new joint-government called the Government of National Accord. However, only a year later the peace was shattered, plunging the country into a three-way civil war.\n\nIt seems that the internationally backed Government of National Accord has managed to overcome the rebellious factions and unite the country, despite lacking the backing of the Libyan military. Being recognized by the EU and much of the Western world, this is a vast shift of balance in the region."

Supplied and backed by Russia, Haftar has promised land for two Russian military bases in the country. This will see an increase of Russian influence in North Africa."

 SierraLeoneNews.1.SIE.d: "The Sierra Leonean government announced an official victory over the rebels today.

The leader of RUF, [AFR.GetLeader], was found in a hideout and arrested, and was handed to the custody of the British SAS.\n\nHe is currently awaiting his trial, being charged of multiple accounts of war crimes by the UN."
 SierraLeoneNews.1.AFR.d: "Despite help from the British and UN troops, the governmental forces of Sierra Leone have been completely driven out of the capital Freetown. Some members of the government had time to evacuate to Nigeria. Others unfortunate enough to be captured by the rebels were promptly gunned down and paraded through the streets of Freetown.\n\nSeveral days of looting has occurred after the fall of the government, as rebels across the country celebrate their victory.\n\nThe country will most likely fall to anarchy and chaos as the militias no longer have any other enemies apart from the local populace."

 LiberiaNews.1.LIB.d: "Today Charles Taylor, the dictator-president of Liberia, announced the end of LURD in Liberia. Despite the Liberian military being in shambles, and most of the work being done by Taylor's anti-terrorist units, LURD with their Guinean allies weren't able to topple his government. What remaining rebels there are have crossed the border and escaped the Guinea. It is likely that Taylor will continue the conflict with Guinea until all opposition is dealt with."
 LiberiaNews.1.LUR.d: "In a televised broadcast today, Charles Taylor announced his resignation as the president of Liberia. Shortly after, he boarded a plane to fly into exile into Nigeria, as LURD rebels danced all along the streets of Monrovia. Due to suspected war crimes, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for  Taylor. However, the Nigerian government has refused to deport Taylor, unless the request comes from the new Liberian government itself.\n\nThe new Liberian government is still in an on-going reorganisation, and it will take time until it establishes itself in Monrovia, and then in the rest of the country."

 Liberia.2.d: "The Taylor government has driven out the LURD rebels from Liberia.

We lost contact with some of our military units and our commanders, our supply depot responsible stop responding and we didn't even know where our enemy was. The fronts have now stabilised and it is a bit more clear who is on whose side, but many challenges still remain.\n\nOur military is composed of veterans and volunteers, with no clear picture of the chain of command. We are struggling with supplying our troops and establishing direct supply routes. We also don't have a clear picture of battles that have been fought and what tactics our enemy is using. What should we do first?"

However, the military still lacks overall cohesion and many units and militias operate independently from central command.\n\nOur military has a chain of command, but responsibilities and authorities are not always respected.
