 IND_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Indonesia is the center of East Asian affairs despite being rocked by economic troubles. The 1997 Asian financial crisis has crippled Indonesia's currency, the Rupiah which has brought much instability to the archipelago nation, further flamed by the fires raging in Aceh. Rising inflation, radicalization and disunity amongst the nation has been causing it to fall behind it's neighbors and the rest of the world, and it has left its leaders scratching their heads on what to do in order to survive the 21st century"
