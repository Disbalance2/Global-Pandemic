 georg.1000.t: "Epoch of Shevardnadze"
 georg.1000.d: "Eduard Amvrosievich Shevardnadze lived three lives: as a Soviet party functionary, creator of perestroika and new thinking, and leader of independent Georgia. No one could have foreseen these turns, least of all himself. Like his patron Mikhail Gorbachev, Shevardnadze is more respected and appreciated in the world than at home. Some argue that he consistently failed in everything he undertook, others are convinced that mankind will not forget his historical merits. However, when in March 1992 the Georgian politicians who had just overthrown Zviad Gamsakhurdia offered Shevardnadze to head the country, he agreed. It is difficult to say what was more here: the desire to help the motherland in difficult times or the longing for power and active work. I knew that if I had not returned to Georgia, she would have died,” Shevardnadze said. There was some truth in his words, but, unlike Heydar Aliyev, who found himself in a similar situation, he failed to consolidate society. Probably, Shevardnadze expected to be in a small country "a whale in an aquarium", before whose world authority everyone would bow in unison. Instead, he found himself in a society brought to a boiling point, and surrounded by armed barons determined to obey no one. The crisis in relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia was created by his predecessor Gamsakhurdia. Shevardnadze agreed to a military expedition to Abkhazia in August 1992 under pressure from public opinion and influential military leaders Tengiz Kitovani and Jaba Ioseliani. After the overthrow of Gamashurdia, the pro-Russian Shevardnadze, who is relatively building relations with the West and the East, and shaky on his former authority, must draw up a plan for the further development of Georgia."

 georg_chech.1.d: "Information that about 700 armed Chechen boeviks were planning to enter Abkhazia was disseminated several days ago. The parliamentary minority (political block Revival, leader of which is Aslan Abashidze, lead of Adjara Autonomous Republic) accused the Georgian authorities of using military and political adventurism. Leader of the minority Jemal Gogitidze is positive that Chechen boeviks gathered in Kodori Gorge near the border of Abkhazia are planning to enter Adjara Autonomous Republic through the Black Sea cost. Giorgi Targamadze, leader of the oppositional faction United Georgia, supports the idea and claims that the military and political intrigue is made up by the authorities in order to draw the society’s attention away from conflict between Shevardnadze and Zhvania (head of the parliament) and serve to Russia’s interests in Georgia”, the Resonance states. Citizens Union – the ruling party, on the other hand, regards the government of Adjara that supports the interests of Russia. Illegal dislocation of Russian military forces in the neighborhood of Cholokhi (Adjara) was reviewed at the Defense and Security Committee session yesterday. Everything should be done for the Russian military bases to leave the territory of Georgia because they hinder the country’s security, head of the Committee Gia Baramidze announced. Both ruling and opposition parties try to collect scores for just the upcoming elections while the internal situation in the country is very tense. Making the theme of Abkhazia active and talking about possible enemies is a part of the electoral campaign”, this is how the newspaper evaluated the comments of government representatives. It is also worth pointing out that Russia has sent a descant to the Gudauta military base, territory of Abkhazia, in order to find and catch 13 Chechen boeviks thought to be dislocated there (the Resonance). According to Khizri Aldamov, nonofficial representative of Chechnya in Georgia, none of these 13 boeviks are nationally Chechen; they are citizens of the Russian Federation. It may be considered that they pretend they are Chechens. Adequate facts have occurred earlier as well. Russia had them come to Georgia deliberately in order to have Georgia involved in provocation, Aldamov stated."

From the Kodori Gorge, which belongs to Abkhazia but is controlled by Georgia, combined detachments of Georgian partisans and militants from the North Caucasus descended into the territory controlled by Sukhumi. Troops are being pulled up to the Abkhazian-Georgian borders. The Georgian parliament demanded the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers from the conflict zone, Abkhazia, in turn, announced that it would apply for inclusion in Russia: armed phase. We will try to discuss this topic with the representative of Abkhazia in Moscow Igor Akhba, the Georgian parliamentarian Hamlet Chipashvili and the Tbilisi correspondent Yuri Vachnadze. So, real battles are going on in the Kodori Gorge and several questions arise at once. The Kodori Gorge geographically belongs to Abkhazia, but was controlled until recently by Georgia. Igor Akhba, the representative of Abkhazia in Moscow, is speaking."

In recent years, the 75-year-old president did not solve the country's problems but put them on the back burner. Georgia's resources were spent solely to maintain the power of Shevardnadze. Shevardnadze deceived his people. He allowed or even organized electoral fraud himself. It was this lie that led to his resignation. He saved the country from bloodshed, and this is his merit.

There was clearly no quorum - half of the deputies did not recognize the election results. Shevardnadze had to do something to get the parliament started, but he couldn't do anything.

The Rose Revolution will cause some anxiety among post-Soviet presidents. Similar unrest will happen in Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.

Zhvania came to visit his friend, the deputy governor of one of the regions of Georgia. After a while, the Prime Minister's security became worried because he did not return calls. At 4:30 local time, the guards broke the window and found the bodies of Z. Zhvania and his friend. According to the preliminary version voiced by V. Merabishvili, there was an accident - death was the result of gas poisoning. However, David Morchiladze, general director of the Tbilisi gas distribution company JSC Tbilgaz, told Rustavi 2 television after inspecting the apartment that there was no natural gas leak. According to him, a gas heater was installed in the apartment. And, in all likelihood, for some time the product of incomplete combustion of gas accumulated in the apartment, which could cause poisoning. In addition, according to Ekho Moskvy, now all approaches to the entrance of the house where Z. Zhvania died are cordoned off by the police. Journalists are also not allowed to enter the republican hospital where his body was sent. As the hospital doctor told the media representatives, they will not speak to the press until the examination is completed. "We were informed that the President ordered not to communicate with journalists," he said. An emergency meeting of the government has already been held in Tbilisi, convened on the occasion of the death of Z. Zhvania. President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili addressed the meeting. According to him, Georgia has lost a great patriot, and M. Saakashvili himself - his closest friend, most reliable adviser and comrade-in-arms. The President called on the government to be firm, resilient and united. In addition, M. Saakashvili expressed condolences to the families of Z. Zhvania and Raul Yusupov, who died with him.
