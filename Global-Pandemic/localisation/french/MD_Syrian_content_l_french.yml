 SyriaFocusNews.0.t: "Liberation of Rojava"
 SyriaFocusNews.0.d: "In a surprising move today, the Syrian officials have promised the areas controlled by the Rojava full independence. The Syrian head of government stated that 'It is time for a new era for Kurds in the Middle-East'. Shortly after the announcement, the foreign ministries of Turkey, Iraq and Iran released statements that 'This decision will only bring more instability for the region'"
 SyriaFocusNews.0.a: "Interesting"
 SyriaFocusNews.1.t: "Integration of Rojava"
 SyriaFocusNews.1.d: "The officials of Rojava have agreed that the areas controlled by them are to be integrated back into Syria.

 SyriaFocusNews.2.t: "Autonomy for Rojava"

 SyriaFocusNews.4.d1: "The Syrian Social Nationalist Party have attempted to stage a coup in Syria. In a strike in Damascus, they have managed to assassinate Bashar Al Assad during a ceremonial troop inspection. The lack of Assad has allowed them to gather support from previously pro-Assad factions.\n\nThis new conflict might give rise to a Syria, which will likely target their neighbours first, as the SSNP dreams of a Greater Syria."
 SyriaFocusNews.4.d2: "The Syrian Social Nationalist Party have attempted to stage a coup in Syria. Several attacks have been made accross Syria, and it seems the country is falling into another civil war.\n\nThis new conflict might give rise to a Syria, which will likely target their neighbours first, as the SSNP dreams of a Greater Syria."

 SyriaFocusNews.5.d: "In order to prevent another bloodshed in Syria, the ruling officials of Free Syria have decided to form Syria into a federal republic based on ethnic and religious divisions. Hopefully this will reduce the sectarian violence that has been rampant in the country after the war."

 SyriaFocusNews.6.t: "Ethnic Conflict in Syria"
 SyriaFocusNews.6.d: "After the end of the Syrian Civil War, the Free Syrian government had promised the Kurds an autonomous status in Syria. Now the Free Syrian government has changed their mind, and the Kurds have once again risen up against their oppressors. This will most likely lead to even more conflict in Syria."
 SyriaFocusNews.6.a: "Another war?"
 SyriaFocusNews.7.t: "Second Syrian Occupation of Lebanon"

 SyriaFocusNews.13.t: "The Damascus Spring"
 SyriaFocusNews.13.d: "A wave of protests has erupted across Syria. After the death of the previous President Hafez al-Assad, people have been demanding a more open and democratic government.

Hariri, along with 21 other people died in the explosion, leaving 220 others wounded. Responsibility for the attack has been claimed by 'The Nasra and Jihad Group in Greater Syria', a previously unknown organisation. Many believe that the Syrian government is behind this assassination, as Hariri was an outspoken critic of their occupation. The leader of the Hezbollah [HEZ.GetLeader] is claiming that the attack was orchestrated by Israel to force Syria to leave Lebanon"
 SyriaFocusNews.14.a: "Horrible"
 SyriaFocusNews.15.t: "Failed assassination of Rafic Hariri"
 SyriaFocusNews.15.d: "Today, when the Prime Minister of Lebanon was leaving parliament in his motorcade, a car bomb exploded while passing the St. George Hotel. Luckily, the motorcade was far away enough from the explosion, and Hariri survived despite being seriously wounded. Several others were killed, and roughly 200 people were wounded. Responsibility for the attack has been claimed by 'The Nasra and Jihad Group in Greater Syria', a previously unknown organisation. Many believe that the Syrian government is behind this assassination, as Hariri was an outspoken critic of their occupation.

 SyriaFocusNews.16.a: "Hurrah for democracy"
 SyriaFocusNews.17.t: "Syria Moves in on Lebanon"
 SyriaFocusNews.17.d: "In mid-session, the Lebanese Parliament was stormed by the Syrian military and security personnel. Several members of parliament were arrested under the charges of suspected terrorism. While this was happening, Syrian military units, some accompanied by Hezbollah militias, moved on Lebanese Army bases in order to disarm the Lebanese Army. Security for several key military installations is now shared between the Syrian Arab Army and the Hezbollah.\n\nThe Syrian government is referring to this as an anti-terrorist operation, but in practice the Lebanese Parliament is now fully controlled by pro-Syrian politicians and Hezbollah members. Syria has essentially gained full control over the country"
 SyriaFocusNews.17.a: "Outrageous!"
 SyriaFocusNews.18.t: "Syria Withdraws from Lebanon"
 SyriaFocusNews.18.d: "Facing increasing pressure from the international community and the Lebanese public, the Syrian Arab Army has decided to withdraw from Lebanon, leaving the security of the country fully to the Lebanese Military"

 SyriaFocusNews.21.d: "Syria and Egypt have decided to reform the United Arab Republic. After negotiations of the Ba'ath Party leaders between both countries, the two have decided to revive the Ba'athist dream of pan-Arabism. All previous Arab Unions have only lasted a few years, it will be left to be seen how long this will last."
 SyriaFocusNews.21.a: "Nonsensical"

 Syria.1.t: "Victory in the Civil War!"
 Syria.1.SYR.desc: "We have finally beaten both the forces of the Syrian opposition and the disgusting Islamists of Tahrir Al-Sham and ISIS. We can now start rebuilding our country and focusing on the future."
 Syria.1.FSA.desc: "The dictatorial regime of Assad has fallen, and we've neutralised the threat of the Islamists. Syria is finally free!"
 Syria.1.NUS.desc: "Allah has granted us victory over dictator Assad and the Free Syrian Army. This is truly a divine sign, making our cause more just than ever"
 Syria.1.a: "No Power Can Overcome Us!"
 Syria.2.t: "The Fate of Tahrir Al-Sham"
 Syria.2.desc: "Throughout the Syrian civil war, we've had an uneasy alliance with the Tahrir Al-Sham, also known as the Al-Nusra Front. We have avoided conflict with them, so we could focus on taking out the Assad regime. However, as the dust settles, our forces are starting across the border at theirs.\n\nWe could continue the civil war, and take them out. On the other hand, we could promise them representation in whatever government we will form in the future, and they will most likely demand us to hold to that promise."
 Syria.2.a: "Offer them representation"
 Syria.2.b: "Take them out!"
 Syria.3.t: "Syrian Opposition Offers Representation"
 Syria.3.desc: "The Syrian Opposition has contacted us and offered a position in their government. They promise that we will be able to operate politically in the coming regime. It is likely that if we refuse they will start military actions against us."
 Syria.3.a: "We will rule Syria together"
 Syria.3.b: "Never! We need to take them out!"
 Syria.4.t: "Tahrir Al-Sham Joins the Opposition"

 Syria.5.a: "Strike them before they strike us!"

 Syria.14.t: "The Status of Rojava"
 Syria.14.desc: "The Rojava are a Kurdish dominated self-governing area in northern Syria. During the civil war, they fought mainly against ISIS with other secular and progressive militias and factions. Their end goal was to create a federal Syrian republic, though many see the area just as Western Kurdistan. Demanding that they submit to us will most likely lead into a civil war. We could always offer them limited autonomy, though this means we won't be able to fully control them. Letting them go might increase Kurdish nationalism in the area."
 Syria.14.a: "The area is part of Syria"
 Syria.14.b: "Offer them autonomy"
 Syria.14.c: "Give them independence"
 Syria.15.t: "The shattered remains of Tahrir al-Sham joins under our banner"
 Syria.15.d: "With Assads murderous forces advancing deep into Idlib, the hardline islamist coalition of Tahrir al-Sham have suffered irreversible losses and their unity has broken down. As the Free Syrian Army is a wide coalition of groups, we are also welcoming to islamists as long as they commit to our dream of a free Syria. The islamist militias see now the benefits of operating under a more moderate banner as it will allow them to recieve foreign support. This will increase our coordination of offensives and breath new life into our revolution."
 Syria.15.a: "We welcome our brothers to the true Syrian nation"
 Syria.16.t: "FSA collapses - most of their fighters turns to us"
 Syria.16.d: "Allah is great! Our rival rebel coalition, the Free Syrian Army has essentially collapsed due to large battlefield losses, and most of their remaining militia groups have pledged allegiance to our great islamist coalition as we have been more effective and successful in our jihad against Bashar the godless dog and his Iranian apostate puppetmasters. Years of fighting this brutal civil war has turned most of the former FSA-forces under the sway of islamist ideology. Though we don't exactly agree with the Muslim Brotherhoods interpretation of everything, they are, inshallah, willing to fight together with us in a coordinated fashion, and at least believe in Sharia as the sole law and Islam as the only needed governance of Syria."
 Syria.16.a: "We welcome our brothers to the true banner of Syria"

 SyriaNews.1.t: "Syrian Civil War Over"
 SyriaNews.1.d: "The Syrian Civil War has finally come to a halt. Most of the fighting has died down, and the remaining factions have to plan a new future for Syria"
 SyriaNews.1.a: "Let's hope best for them"
 SyriaNews.2.t: "Truce Between FSA and Tahrir Al-Sham Collapses"
 SyriaNews.2.d: "During the Syrian Civil War, the Free Syrian Army and Tahrir Al-Sham cooperated against the Assad regime. After the fall of Assad, the two parties tried to cooperate but couldn't find a common goal for a unified Syria.\n\nBoth sides now seem to be preparing for a new offensive against each other"
 SyriaNews.2.a: "Let's hope they can settle their differences"
 SyriaNews.3.t: "Free Syrian Army and Tahrir Al-Sham Unite"
 SyriaNews.3.d: "During the Syrian Civil War, the Free Syrian Army and Tahrir Al-Sham cooperated against the Assad regime. After the fall of Assad, the two parties entered negotiations on the future of Syria. Surprisingly, officials of the Free Syrian Army have agreed to give a certain amount of seats in the coming parliament to Tahrir Al-Sham.\n\nMany political analysts predict that this uneasy alliance between the two factions won't be able to survive together for very long"
 SyriaNews.3.a: "Let's hope they get along"

 SyriaNews.8.t: "Syrian Islamists joins with FSA under banner of unity"
 SyriaNews.8.d: "With growing military pressure on the Syrian islamists of Tahrir al-Sham, their unity has broken down and their remaining forces have pledged allegiance to the Free Syrian Army Coalition in a last ditch effort to unify the strength of the Syrian rebels to be able to mount an decisive offensive against Assad's forces. It is likely the possibility of recieving foreign military aid played a large role in convincing the islamists to operate under a more moderate banner."
 SyriaNews.8.a: "Interesting"
 SyriaNews.9.t: "Collapse of the FSA - remaining rebels team up with islamists"
 SyriaNews.9.d: "With growing military pressure on the Free Syrian Army Coalition, their already shaky unity has broken completely down and the remaining militias have mostly pledged allegiance to the Syrian islamists of Tahrir al-Sham. Tahrir al-Sham, which has the former al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra-Front at it's core, have been more effective and successful on the battlefield against Assad's forces, and this added with the growing influence of radical ideology within many FSA-groups has made an large scale switch of allegiance increasingly more likely over time."

Nasrallah has obviously denied the legitimacy of the video, claiming it's 'nothing more than a Zionist plot'.
