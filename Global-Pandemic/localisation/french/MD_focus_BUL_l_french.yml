 WHILE_FOCUSING: "While focusing on this, there will be the following effects:\n$EFF$"
 BUL_generic_political_effort: "Bulgarian Politics"
 BUL_generic_political_effort_desc: "In the year 2000, Bulgaria's political scene saw a dramatic shift as the conservative party, Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), lost power to the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). This marked the end of UDF's eight-year rule and the beginning of BSP's term in office. The new government prioritized economic reforms, focusing on improving the country's financial stability and attracting foreign investment. Despite initial public approval, the reforms proved to be slow and controversial."
 BUL_steady: "Continue the course"
 BUL_steady_desc: "Bulgaria has achieved a lot since the fall of communism in 1989, including the establishment of a democratic government. Nevertheless, there have been recent discussions about the need to shift back to a more authoritarian government. However, there are several reasons why Bulgaria should continue to remain a democracy to truly embrace the economic growth and freedom of our people."
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot: "Increased Privatization"
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot_desc: "Bulgaria's economy has struggled to grow since the fall of communism, and its government has been exploring ways to increase economic growth. One potential solution is to increase the privatization of property in the country. Privatization can potentially lead to increased efficiency, as private companies tend to be more profit-oriented and incentivized to cut costs. This, in turn, could attract foreign investments and create jobs. Additionally, increasing privatization can reduce the government's financial burden as they will no longer have to maintain and manage the properties."
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot_3: "Healthcare Reform"
 BUL_generic_extra_tech_slot_3_desc: "As Bulgaria entered the new millennium, there was a pressing need for healthcare reform.

 BUL_fighting_immigration: "Crush the Opposition"

 BUL_us_military_in_bul_desc: "Bulgaria is a strategic location for the deployment of US troops due to its geographical position in Europe. If Bulgaria allows US troops to be deployed on its land, it will help ensure security in the region. The presence of US troops in Bulgaria will serve as a deterrent for any potential threat or aggression towards the country. It will also contribute to enhancing the collective security of NATO, of which Bulgaria wants to be a member of."
 BUL_novo_selo: "Novo Selo and Graf Ignatievo Airbases"
 BUL_novo_selo_desc: "Bulgaria, a country located in the Balkan region of Europe, should seriously consider opening the US Novo Selo and Graf Ignatievo military airbases. There are plenty of reasons to support this decision. Firstly, by opening these airbases, Bulgaria will strengthen its strategic partnership with the United States. This partnership will offer Bulgaria defense and security benefits that will help protect the country from external threats."
 BUL_befriend_greece_lib: "Friendship with Greece"
 BUL_befriend_greece_lib_desc: "Bulgarian-Greek cooperation in military and economic sectors has strengthened in recent years.

 BUL_friendship_with_romania_desc: "Bulgaria and Romania have been enjoying close cooperation in both military and economic sectors for many years. With a shared history and geography, the two countries have been collaborating on joint military exercises and strategic partnerships to enhance their security and combat regional challenges. The countries have also engaged in cooperative ventures to improve their economic growth, increase cross-border investments and trade, and promote tourism."
 BUL_generic_political_pression: "Improved Administration"
 BUL_generic_political_pression_desc: "Bulgaria should go through an administration reform that should be aimed at improving the effectiveness and accountability of its government institutions. The main objective is to modernize the public administration system and reduce bureaucracy, which had hindered economic growth and foreign investments."
 BUL_liberty_ethos: "Democratic Bulgaria"
 BUL_liberty_ethos_desc: "The year 2000 was a turning point for Bulgarian society as it faced numerous political, economic and social challenges. Despite the difficulties, there is no doubt that the democratic ethos was the best choice for the country. Democracy offers citizens the opportunity to have a say in their government and participate in decision-making processes. This creates a sense of ownership, empowering individuals to take responsibility for their collective destinies. Additionally, democratic societies place great emphasis on individual rights and freedoms, which are critical for personal and societal development."
 BUL_collectivist_ethos: "New Bulgaria, old ways"
 BUL_collectivist_ethos_desc: "The year 2000 marked the start of Bulgaria's democratic establishment. However, many people view it as the worst political leadership in the country's history. One of the primary reasons why it is deemed as such is the fact that the government failed to counter the rampant corruption that plagued the nation. Another factor that contributed to this negative perception was the lack of progress and economic growth. Instead, poverty and unemployment remained prevalent, and the living standards continued to decline. There was also a growing sense of political instability, which eroded public trust and confidence in the government."

 bulg.4.t: "Monarchist Coup in Bulgaria!"
 bulg.4.d: "Bulgaria was hit by a monarchist coup that brought back symbols of the country's former monarchy. The coup was led by a faction within the Bulgarian political leadership, who sought to bring back a constitution similar to the one present in the pre-communist era. This move was met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as an attempt to move Bulgaria towards authoritarianism, while others believed that the restoration of the monarchy would bring stability to the country's politics. The coup was successful, and the new constitution featured the monarchy as a ceremonial head of state. The Bulgarian royal family was granted a significant role in the country's political and social life, and they continue to hold a prominent position in Bulgarian society to this day. With the current government plagued by corruption and economic instability, there is a growing movement in Bulgaria dedicated to the restoration of the monarchy. Led by a group of influential politicians, military leaders and loyalists to the former royal family, this movement seeks to create a constitutional monarchy that will bring stability and prosperity to the nation."
 bulg.4.a: "All hail the Tsar!"

 bulg.5.t: "Communist Revanche in Bulgaria!"
 bulg.5.d: " Bulgaria experienced a communist coup, with the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) gaining power. This was a significant political shift in the country following years of democratic reforms and liberalization. For many Bulgarians, it was a step back towards the communist regime that they had fought so hard to remove. The BSP was able to gain power through a coalition government with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms party. This coalition essentially gave the BSP control of the government, allowing them to implement policies that were reminiscent of the communist era. They implemented more state control over the economy, limiting private enterprise, and increasing government spending on social policies."

 bulg.7.t: "Bulgarian Politics"
 bulg.7.d: "In the year 2000, Bulgaria was undergoing significant changes in its political landscape. The country was still recovering from the economic and political turmoil of the 1990s, and there was a growing sense of frustration among the people towards the government. The ruling party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), had been in power since 1995 and was facing increasing criticism for its handling of the economy and corruption allegations. In this context, the presidential elections of 2000 were a crucial moment for the country. The incumbent president, Petar Stoyanov, ran for re-election as an independent candidate, promising to continue his pro-European and pro-market reforms. He faced a tough challenge from the BSP's candidate, Georgi Parvanov, who promised a return to socialist policies and closer ties with Russia. In the end, Stoyanov won a narrow victory, securing a second term in office. However, Parvanov's strong showing signaled a shift in the political climate"

The campaign included billboards and advertisements that called on Macedonians to "unite with the Bulgarian brothers" and claimed that the two nations shared a common history and culture.

Supporters of the idea argue that a close relationship with Bulgaria would bring greater economic benefits and improve living standards for Macedonian citizens. However, opponents of the proposal believe that it would undermine Macedonias sovereignty and national identity. The protests against joining Bulgaria have been particularly strong among ethnic Albanian communities in Macedonia, who express concern that their cultural and political rights would be diminished under Bulgarian rule. Meanwhile, Bulgarian officials have denied any intention of annexing or absorbing Macedonia and have instead proposed greater cooperation and integration between the two countries."

The operation was a success, with a number of individuals linked to the extremist organization being detained. This move signals an effort from both countries to tackle extremist activity and maintain stability in the region. The extremist organization in question has been advocating for the creation of a Greater Macedonia, which includes parts of Bulgaria and Greece. This has led to tensions between the countries and has fueled violent incidents in the past. By working together, Bulgaria and Macedonia are sending a message that such radicalism is not welcome and will not be tolerated."

Bulgaria claims that parts of the Republic of North Macedonia's national identity and language have been artificially constructed in a bid to strengthen its own territorial claim. However, North Macedonia has consistently denied this, stating that such allegations are baseless and unfounded. In recent times, both nations have shown a willingness to negotiate and work towards a resolution. The European Union has also played a significant role in mediating and facilitating talks between the two sides. A resolution of this dispute would be crucial to furthering regional cooperation and reducing tensions among the Balkan states. Macedonia could lose it's sovereignty because of this conflict..."

The country had experienced a period of hyperinflation in the early 1990s, followed by a period of stabilization and gradual economic growth. However, in 1996, Bulgaria suffered a severe economic crisis which was partly the result of a banking system collapse and a sharp depreciation of the national currency. By the year 2000, Bulgaria's economy was slowly recovering from the crisis, but still faced a number of challenges. The country's GDP was growing at a moderate rate, but unemployment remained high and poverty levels were significant.
