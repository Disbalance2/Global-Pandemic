 italy_md.22.t: "Reform Expectance"
 italy_md.22.d: "To represent Italian political instability, one of the main features of the new content given to Italy is the \"Reform Expectance\" dynamic modifier. Parties in the ruling coalition will see their popularity rapidly deteriorate unless policies that satisfy the population are enacted. If a coalition member sees its popularity drop below half of the value it was elected with it will leave the coalition. If the coalition loses too much popularity a government crisis will be triggered that can be resolved with new elections or by trying to keep the government alive at the expense of stability. The amount of reform expectance is affected by focuses, events and decisions but it's not static. Depending on your laws, tax level, interest rate and stability reform expectance will shift to higher or lower levels. Having a technocratic government will also increase reform expectance over time and increase the political power cost of reforms."

 italy_md.24.d: "After more than 50 years of works, the Salerno-to-Reggio Calabria Motorway has opened! The motorway underwent heavy modernisation, and in many cases a completely new parallel motorway was built alongside the original one and involved in most cases a complete rebuilding or replacement of the road where the alignment was retained. Now that the motorway is finally opened, going to and coming from Calabria is going to be way easier, considering that half a century ago it was considered the 'Third Island of Italy' due to the nature of the terrain."
 italy_md.24.o1: "It was about time!"
 italy_md.25.t: "Space Decisions and Military Branch"
 italy_md.25.d: "By completing the \"Increase ASI Funding\" in the \"Great Projects\" branch of the Industrial focus tree you'll unlock access to a set of space-related decisions. A recurring decision allows you to dedicate more resources to Scientific Space Exploration, which will cost a significant amount of money but will provide research speed increase and a small boost to political power. Most importantly, growing your space program will eventually unlock the capability to setup an Outpost on the Moon which, in turn, will serve as a base for asteroid mining. Asteroid mining allows you to take advantage of strategic raw resources as long as you'll be willing to sustain the pretty significant yearly financial cost required to sustain such endeavour. At the same time you will need to keep your population sufficiently satisfied by the achievment of your space program, otherwise the great expenses and efforts it requires won't be justified any longer and further operations might have to be aborted.\n\nThe new military branch contains several focuses that allow you to specialize equipment, these trigger events that let you choose between reducing the production cost and reliability of a certain equipment type or increasing its cost and it's combat stats. The bonuses granted in this way will be shown in a single idea for each military branch to avoid national spirits window cluttering. Another new feature is the ability to upgrade officers in the leadership section, this will retire an officer and create a new one with the same name but better stats. This process implies you will need to enlist the officer again if he was in use."

 italy_md.28.t: "Criminals sabotage our industries!"
 italy_md.28.d: "Earlier today we received news that our industries and infrastructures were sabotages by heavily equipped criminals. The industries were set on fire and huge explosions happened on highways. Our secret agencies discovered that the attacks are an answer from the feared leaders of the '§tMafia§!' who didn't take our recent actions against them lightly."
 italy_md.28.o1: "We need to step back"
 italy_md.28.o2: "More reasons to erase them from the face of the Earth!"
 italy_md.29.t: "Criminals sabotage our military industries!"
 italy_md.29.d: "Once again, an attack on our industries took place, as well as bomb attacks on buses and trains. Besides the damanged industries, an unestimated number of people died in the terror attacks in city centres. Once again, all these attacks are connected with organized criminality. When will this ever stop?"
 italy_md.29.o1: "We really need to step back"
 italy_md.29.o2: "This won't stop us!"
 italy_md.30.t: "§tMafia§!"
 italy_md.30.d: "Organized criminality is a significant problem in Italy. In the game this is represented with the new §tMafia§! mechanics. All 4 southern states have a major \"Clan\" associated to them:  §2Cosa Nostra§! in §2Sicily§!, §0Camorra§! in §0Campania§!, §7'Ndrangheta§! in §7Calabria§! and §9Sacra Corona Unita§! in §9Puglia§!. Each clan has a strength value that directly reduces growth in the region in which they operate by reducing construction speed and increasing costs and time of foreign investments. Furthermore an average value of all strengths is used to calculate how much §tMafia§! affects the country as a whole through the §tMafia§! national spirit and by increasing focus tree expenditures cost. Industrial focuses now not only have a higher cost based on the current value of mafia influence, but will also increase mafia strength according to how much money criminals are able to siphon off the projects. To fight criminals Italy must employ its police forces and ensure italians collaborate in the eradication of §tMafia§!. §tMafia§! strength increases passively over time, but this increase can be lowered, and even reversed, by taking some national focuses. Furthermore effectivness of decisions to fight mafia will be based on the Police Effectivness value. That value is influenced by some focuses, Corruption, Police funding, regional §tMafia§! strength and the amount of undercover agents in the region. Once average mafia strength has been negligible for some years a victory over §tMafia§! can be finally declared."

 italy_md.30.o2: "Enough explanations."
 italy_md.31.t: "Weekly Stability"
 italy_md.31.d: "Many focuses and mechanics in this rework are based on weekly stability. Since vanilla HOI4 has a hard cap on how much that modifier can influence stability, a national spirit has been introduced to ensure the values are applied correctly indefinitely. Most of the choices in the tree will be between an option that grants big immediate benefits in term of stability, with an over time decrease, and an option that will instead lower your stability immediately but increase it gradually over time.\n\nThis is needed because HOI4 has a pool of stability with size 100 that can be filled or emptied by effects simply granting stability, not attached to a spirit or other effects, and by weekly stability. When this pool is completely full or empty you can no longer add or subtract weekly stability. When this occurs this mechanic will add weekly stability to the multipurpose modifier. Because of this, if the weekly stability gain is reversed the multipurpose modifier stability will be affected only when the pool is completely full or empty again."

 italy_md.38.d: "Italians have lost faith in this government's ability to implement the reforms they feel are necessary. The opposition is asking for new elections, but with some political compromises we can keep our seats for some extra time, what should we do?\n\n A government crisis will be triggered if the government coalition falls below half of the popularity it was elected with. This can happen because of the coalition parties losing popularity or leaving the coalition outright (something which they'll do if they lose too much popularity). Government crisis may also be triggered when a junior coalition party grows significantly more popular then the ruling party."

 italy_md.39.d: "The main mechanic of the political branch of the Italian Focus Tree are policies. Policies become available once their focus is completed, but you don't simply get the effects with the focus. Instead policies have been moved to decisions which can be enacted and repealed multiple times, allowing for greater roleplay and metagaming possibilities. But beware, repealing a policy won't provide the exact opposite effects it granted when enacted, especially in regards to reform expectance.\n\nThe section of the focus tree above the policies is dedicated to party leaders. Since automatic retiring of party leaders following a lost election has been disabled for Italy, this section was created to ensure changes in leadership are possible."

 italy_md.40.d: "Matteo Salvini, a member of the European Parliament for the Lega Nord party, has gathered enough support in his party to overthrow Bossi and assume leadership. Salvini is an hardline eurosceptic politician critical of both the political and economic union. He has strong ties with Russia and supports the neo-nationalist movement that push against globalization, immigration and the free market. His leadership is going to transform lega nord from a party focused on northern regions and their request for federalism to a national party that tries to build a national identity with the use of various appropriately manufactured external enemies like foreigners, migrants, banks, neighbouring countries and many more."

 italy_md.41.d: "A prominent italian comedian, Beppe Grillo, following the advice of Gianroberto Casaleggio has organized the several civic lists and organisations of supporters into an actual party, called the Five Stars Movement. The movement has been formed to create a platform for all the people disappointed by politics, increasingly perceived as distant and corrupt. It strongly advocates for direct democracy through the use of the tools made available by internet, with role elections and other decisions being carried out in a private internet platform owned by Casaleggio. Despite this, the actual power remains in the hands of its leadership, which is free to shape the party very actively, freely switching between right wing and left wing stances on various issues. Despite the ideological flexibility, the core of the party can be mostly described as a green party with a nimby focused approach to enviromentalism and a strong no-globalisation stance on economic issues. Unlike right wing populist parties, the five star movements values its ties with China more than those with Russia."
