It went into effect in 1970 and has been the standard of nuclear arms control ever since. However, that decision was made by the Shah's U.S.-aligned government prior to the 1979 Revolution, and it would benefit our people greatly to have such weapons, something which the Shah never considered. However, it has been said that we apporach this with tact, and via diplomatic channels, rather than without international permission. First and foremost, we must approach the Americans, or do we?"

They say that [PER.GetName] is pursuing a compromise with us on the NPT, in return for reopening official diplomatic channels, the reopening of our embassy in Tehran, offering us bases in their country, and allowing us to oversee the nuclear project. This is an extremely tempting offer, as this would allow our Middle Eastern foreign policy to focus on peacekeeping and combating [SOV.GetName], rather than combating both [PER.GetName] and [SOV.GetName].

They are offering 20 billion, not just for the assurance of safety, but also for the development of Kandla's port facilities. This is a very tempting offer, with both the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry breathing down everyone's neck, urging us to take this deal. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Iranians are deperate for this deal, and would probably offer more if we deny a third time. The Ministry of PSW disagrees, and believes that any more shenanigans would lead to this deal falling through, and that we should take it."

The delegates say that the Indians hinted at perhaps accepting a higher offer, but it seems that they were split on taking our generous terms. Now the Minister of Finance says that they are attempting to squeeze out as much money as they can, and the Ministry of Defense agrees, however, the Minister of Defense still believes the deal to be necessary for the acquisition of nuclear weaponry.

This deal took a large amount out of our coffers, but the Ministry of Defense assures us that the deal was imperative, and that we will not regret the cooperation between our two nations."

Patrol craft of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy seized the craft and detained the crew at a military base on Farsi Island. According to western sources, the two RCBs were on a transit from Kuwait to Bahrain, leaving Kuwait at 12:23 p.m local time, and were scheduled to refuel with the USCGC Monomoy at 5 p.m. During the transit one RCB developed an \"engine problem\", and both boats stopped to solve the mechanical issue. During this time they drifted into Iranian waters, where they were detained shortly after.

 PER_rev_flavor.8.d: "Iranian revolutionaries triumphantly march across the capital, Tehran, as they declare victory over the Islamic Republic. This comes as Iran descended into Chaos some months ago, following a brutal government response to a small demonstration in the north of the country. Large swathes of the army stood in solidarity with the revolutionaries, and they subsequently turned against the Islamic Republic, sealing their fate once and for all. Seyyid Ali Khamenei, the former supreme leader of Iran now silently resides in Venezuela, where he has been granted a sanctuary by the Venezuelan government. He has not commented on anything so far, but Iranians are demanding that he be returned and trialed for his crimes during his term as the Supreme Leader. In some time now, Iranian's across the nation will have to decide what government they want ruling Iran moving forward. Western nations have expressed their support for the former Crown Prince, Reza Pahlavi, whilst the Chinese and Russians appear to be backing the MEK, a leftist organization."

 PER_rev_flavor.9.d: "Reza Pahlavi has returned to his former homeland of Iran following his victory in the grand referendum, with crowds of people welcoming him at Tehran International Airport as he walked down the stairs of his plane. His return to Iran brings about a sigh of relief in the west, as his policies of secularization and modernization will drift the nation away from radical Shi'ite Islam, and closer to a secular state that could resemble a potential regional ally. Upon hearing this news, many NATO nations have dropped support for [SAU.GetName], and have returned to backing the Iranians as [SAU.GetAdjective] policies become less appealing due to their violent and repressive nature. This shift in support has stirred new tension between Tehran and Riyadh, which could spiral dangerously out of control if it is not deal with diplomatically by the two parties."

 PER_rev_flavor.10.d: "Massoud Rajavi, the leader of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, expressed his gratitude to a large crowd in Tehran following his victory in the grand referendum. The MEK seeks to bring a mix of Marxist and Islamist ideals to Iran, with a lesser focus on hardline Shi'ism than that of the Islamic Republic. However many in Iran are still demanding a recount of the vote, as the MEK remains largely unpopular amongst many in the nation following their involvement in the Iran-Iraq war, when they sided with Saddam Hussein and fought a brutal eight year war against the Iranian military. Rajavi has stated that the peoples concerns will be heard, and a new order in the middle east will be created, with the Iranian people being more prosperous than ever."

Though, not many were shocked, as the Islamic Republic had long repressed the Iranian identity, and focused on pushing an Islamic one, instilling nationalism amongst many citizens. Much of the world is expressing concern over this news, as the Pan-Iranist main goal is for Iranic peoples to be united under one nation, and one flag, which could mean the start of an endless conflict in the middle east. Pendar Pezeshkpour has come out and stated that their policies will be peaceful, and will focus on a post-revolution recovery plan, putting the nation and regional security at the fore-front of their agenda."

Many people across the nation are absolutely ecstatic to hear this, as the last time Iran had a democracy was back in the 50's, before the CIA couped the system out of power.

The Artesh has been apolitical for most of its modern existance, and had even declared neutrality during the 1979 Islamic Revolution which overthrew the Shah. But after the latest revolutionary movement, the Artesh became more and more involved in helping overthrow the Islamic Republic due to their harsh policies against protesters. Several officers in the Artesh have expressed concern about the military's involvement in politics, with most of it stemming from the influence the IRGC has over the force. Though the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Artesh have vowed to root out any sort of IRGC influence over the military force, many are still worried that radical elements will try and distrupt the day to day governing of the country through covert operations.."
