 Ossetia.10.t: "Ossetian Politics"
 Ossetia.10.d: "In the tumultuous political landscape of South Ossetia in the year 2000, the de facto independent state grappled with ongoing challenges to its legitimacy and territorial disputes with Georgia. Led by President Lyudvig Chibirov, South Ossetia faced a credibility crisis as only a handful of nations, including Russia, recognized its sovereignty, while the majority of the international community, aligned with the United Nations, continued to regard it as an integral part of Georgia. The influence of Russia played a pivotal role, both politically and militarily, shaping the region's ability to maintain de facto independence. Tensions with Georgia remained high, marked by sporadic outbreaks of violence along the administrative boundary, hindering efforts for a peaceful resolution. Against this backdrop, the unresolved conflicts and humanitarian concerns posed significant challenges, underscoring the need for sustained international diplomatic efforts to bring stability to the region."
