 mars_colony_tt: "As time goes on, our Mars Colony may experience challenges or crises which may endanger it. However, if it successful, the rewards will be tremendous.\n"

 chi_mars.1.t: "Mars Rover Mission"
 chi_mars.1.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send our Rover to the mars. It has a total sum of roughly 14 sensors installed, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment. This Rover will need to be regularly moved as the Mars day lasts 1 1/5 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Mars.\n\nThe Rover itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Mars. Extraction of ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for future astronauts on the Mars, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Mars to allow easier access to the Mars, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
 chi_mars.1.o1: "Launch!"

 chi_mars.2.t: "Mars Colony Project"
 chi_mars.2.d: "If humans want to colonize Mars, they must establish a permanent base that is self-sustaining. This is the dream of countless space explorers and the only way for humans to set foot in the space. All this will become a reality today."
 chi_mars.2.o1: "Mars here we come!"

 chi_mars.3.t: "Landing System failure"
 chi_mars.3.d: "After a journey of nearly 60 million kilometers, our spacecraft finally appeared over Mars. The iron oxide all over Mars showed a red appearance. The planet, long visible only through a lens, is now within sight. \n"The spacecraft enters landing mode." The captain, who had practiced countless times on the simulator, issued the order, but there seemed to be a problem with the landing device. At this time, large beads of sweat instantly covered the captain's forehead."
 chi_mars.3.o1: "Taiyuan, we've had a problem."

 chi_mars.4.t: "Vehicle Failure"
 chi_mars.4.d: "After a thrilling half hour, the spacecraft finally escaped the risk of crashing and landed crookedly on the Mars Utopia Plain. This is also the landing site of the previous Zhurong rover. It is recognized as the largest impact basin on Mars and the solar system, with an estimated diameter of 3,300 kilometers. \nAfter landing, the crew will transfer to a special rover and head to the southern part of the plain to establish a base, but the vibrations from the previous landing of the spacecraft seem to have had some impact on the rover. It is clear that situation has developed not necessarily to crew's advantage"
 chi_mars.4.o1: "There seems to be something wrong with our bloody vehicle today."

 chi_mars.5.t: "Arrival at Base"
 chi_mars.5.d: "40 kilometers, the first time humans have traveled such a long march on a planet other than Earth. Such an ordinary distance on earth is a breakthrough in the history of human spaceflight. \nAfter going through the tense process of setting up camp, transmitting all necessary data back to the earth, and checking the parameters of all equipment, the captain who was sitting on the bed could finally take a drink of water. \nThrough the window of transparent synthetic material above the head, a light point among the stars shone with a little blue light, and that was the Earth. \n\n'Better.' the captain muttered."
 chi_mars.5.o1: "Don’t be afraid of being late for a good meal."

 chi_mars.6.t: "Successful Landing"
 chi_mars.6.d: "Everything was perfect, as expected, the spacecraft landed at the designated landing site exactly, and the human journey to Mars began in peace. \n"
 chi_mars.6.o1: "I knew our crew would be able to complete the mission."

 chi_mars.7.t: "Arrival at Base"
 chi_mars.7.d: "The landing point of the spacecraft was the preset address of the base, and the crew began to camp on the spot to prepare for the construction of mankind's first permanent base on Mars. No one noticed that the space boots left countless messy footprints on the Martian soil."
 chi_mars.7.o1: "One small step for Mars, one giant leap for mankind."

 chi_mars.8.t: "Locate Water Source"
 chi_mars.8.d: "Water is an essential resource for human survival. One of the main purposes of previous Mars exploration activities was to find water sources on Mars. Although there are no surface lakes or rivers like Earth, Mars' water resources basically exist in the form of ice under the surface of Mars. \nHowever, the actual precise positioning requires someone to conduct on-site surveys in person."
 chi_mars.8.o1: "Paper will sleep shallow, never know the matter want to practice. "

 chi_mars.9.t: "Underground Radiation Protection"
 chi_mars.9.d: "Due to the thin atmosphere of Mars and the lack of a planetary magnetic field, radiation from space reaches the surface unimpeded. The base could not provide enough shelter when it was first built, so digging a nest in the ground became the first choice to avoid radiation. \nWitnessing the operation of the excavator's long arm, the crew remembered the past when the Republic built the first oil base in the Songnen Plain."
 chi_mars.9.o1: "Just like days in Daqing"

 chi_mars.10.t: "The First Harvest on Mars"
 chi_mars.10.d: "The problem of water sources has been solved, and the energy source is temporarily provided by solar power. Therefore, the production of food on Mars has become the most important matter at present. \nTraditional cereal crops have been excluded due to their growth cycles and harvesting processes, and potatoes have become the first human crops to be grown on Mars. Although Mars is not as bright as Earth due to the distance from the sun, the potatoes in the greenhouse seem to grow more lushly. Humanity's first harvest on Mars is in sight."
 chi_mars.10.o1: "All nature, organic, Martian-grown potatoes."

 chi_mars.11.t: "Sandstorm"
 chi_mars.11.d: "Sandstorm are a common occurrence on Mars. Although the air pressure on Mars is much lower than that of the Earth, the Martian storm is not as devastating as the previous legends, just like in that movie. \nHowever, the raised dust still poses a lot of hidden dangers to human bases, especially since solar energy is an indispensable energy source for current bases."
 chi_mars.11.o1: "We have no chance to save Matt Damon here."

 chi_mars.12.t: "Accident"
 chi_mars.12.d: "To go up the mountain often and eventually run into a tiger. The Martian dust storm lasted far longer than previously expected, and the battery life inside the base seemed to be in a very pessimistic situation. \nIn order to continue the Mars colony mission, we need to make a decision, choose to evacuate and find a new location, or continue to repair the damaged facilities."
 chi_mars.12.o1: "Evacuate"
 chi_mars.12.o2: "Fix Base"

 chi_mars.13.t: "Evacuate"
 chi_mars.13.d: "We can't wait any longer. The situation is now very critical and it's time to use backup rockets for evacuation. After checking that all the team members had safely boarded the ship, the captain reluctantly looked back at the base building that was still in building. He suppressed the grief in his heart and gave the order to the artificial intelligence guide to launch the spacecraft. \n'We will be back!' As a huge burst of smoke rose, the spacecraft broke away from the Martian ground and slowly rose into the sky."
 chi_mars.13.o1: "Where there is life, there is hope."

 chi_mars.14.t: "Repair Damaged Base"
 chi_mars.14.d: "We cannot sit back and wait, we must start repairs on the base immediately with any cost, otherwise all the gains we have made on Mars will be ruined, and no one can survive in this chaos. Saving the base means saving ourselves."
 chi_mars.14.o1: "For the sake of sacrifice and great ambition, we dare to make a new world."

 chi_mars.15.t: "Mars City Project"
 chi_mars.15.d: "We have made outstanding achievements in building a Mars colony. But there is still some distance to go before we can finally achieve our goal. Do we still want to continue investing in Mars construction?"
 chi_mars.15.o1: "Upgrade"
 chi_mars.15.o2: "Don´t need it"

 chi_mars.16.t: "Yes"
 chi_mars.16.d: "As long as we take one more step forward, our mission on Mars will be completely completed. There is no half-measures in our agenda."
 chi_mars.16.o1: "Don't pass the responsibility to the next generation."
 
 chi_mars.17.t: "No"
 chi_mars.17.d: "The current Mars base is complete enough, and it is unwise to continue to invest more. We still have many problems to face on earth, and it is impossible to just throw money into space."
 chi_mars.17.o1: "Believe in the wisdom of future generations."

 chi_mars.18.t: "Mars City completed"
 chi_mars.18.d: "After our unremitting efforts, our colony on Mars has finally been completed. Human beings will never forget these efforts, and one day human beings will set foot on the entire galaxy."
 chi_mars.18.o1: "Our journey is the whole galaxy."
 
 chi_mars.19.t: "Established New Sub-base"
 chi_mars.19.d: "As more spacecraft brought more personnel and materials, the originally Mars base began to prosper. The water resources under the original base can no longer carry more people, and it is urgent to establish a new sub-base. \nAs the spacecraft of the first team gradually disappeared from sight, the former captain and today the mayor of first new Beijing city recalled the past when the Mars rover fell into a trench."
 chi_mars.19.o1: "Mom, I’m going on a long voyage today."
 
 chi_mars.20.t: "Mars City Monument"
 chi_mars.20.d: "As humans have traveled across Mars, Mars has become the new home for humans on Earth. The terraforming of Mars is proceeding in an orderly manner. At the first landing point of the human spacecraft, a huge monument was built to commemorate the men and women who sacrificed their lives during the journey and construction in the process of conquering Mars. They will forever be engraved in the journey of human civilization."
 chi_mars.20.o1: "For the mankind!"

 #Lunar Outpost Event Chain
 chi_moon.1.t: "Outpost on the Moon"
 chi_moon.1.d: "Our scientists and engineers are ready to send astronauts and equipment to live semi-permanently on the Moon. A total sum of roughly 12 astronauts will be sent there, along with tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, supplies, living spaces, and personal items. This outpost will need to be regularly moved as the Lunar day lasts 29 Earth days, which is far too long for batteries to keep stored power on the Moon.\n\nThe base itself will be on the poles, easily moveable, to get the maximum usage of our solar panels. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to determine long-term living conditions on the Moon. Extraction of lunar ice could not only lead to liquid water for plants and food for astronauts on the Moon, but also lead to separating it into oxygen and hydrogen, rocket fuel.\n\nThis may take months or years to get the research needed to do this. Within this time, however, using the funds for this project, we will build a depot orbiting the Moon to allow easier access to the Moon, and refueling to get to Earth.\n\nAll of this is achievable within the next decade. Now, however, is the time to launch."
 chi_moon.1.o1: "Launch!"

 chi_moon.2.t: "Moonbase Alpha"
 chi_moon.2.d: "Our scientists and engineers have officially landed on the Moon, and are currently in the process of setting up the Moon-base. Each section is divided into \"modules,\" not quite buildings on their own, but not together as one. There is a habitation module, for rest, food module, for growing food, lab module, which is the largest with most of the scientific equipment, a maintenance module, containing all the maintenance tools to repair things if they get broken, an amenities module, since these people are here for 6 months, and working all day everyday isn't good for the mind, and quite a few solar panels.\n\nFood deliveries will be common for these first months as it takes time to grow food. Water and oxygen will be obtained through the Lunar ice. Lastly, these scientists will stay until shortly after moving to the next location in roughly 6 months time when the solar panels become defunct due to the Lunar day and night where the outpost is located lasts 6 months.\n\nMoonbase Alpha is complete."
 chi_moon.2.o1: "Science!"

 chi_moon.3.t: "Colony Progresses"
 chi_moon.3.d: "Our scientific outpost on the Moon has had a major breakthrough. With expansion of their current solar panel network, and recent discoveries making separating water to make oxygen and hydrogen easier, they have been able to come up with enough oxygen and hydrogen to fully fuel the most recent supply rocket. This is such a necessary breakthrough which will allow the Moon itself, given enough time and investment, can become a hub for future space ventures into outer space.\n\nSpace itself is getting smaller."
 chi_moon.3.o1: "We're good at being pioneers"

 chi_moon.4.t: "Crisis on the Moon"
 chi_moon.4.d: "Drastic measures need to be taken place immediately. For reasons currently unknown, the habitation module has ruptured and \"exploded.\"\n\nAn hour ago, all 12 scientists were doing their duties when, all of a sudden, there was a massive rupture in the habitation module.\n\nSince waves don't travel in a vacuum, most didn't realize until they physically saw what had happened.\n\nThere is an emergency fund as part of the budget, so there is no need to allocate more funds to the project, and the scientists can always sleep in the other isolated modules; however, this has spooked many, stating that a few, many, or even all of our scientists could have died, and has also lowered the morale of the scientists since they could have died. Thus, attempting to continue the outpost on the Moon will be politically costly, and a rotation of scientists may need to happen now rather than later, due to the sapping of morale.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 chi_moon.4.o1: "Send emergency aid!"
 chi_moon.4.o2: "Abandon the project. It's not meant for us"

 chi_moon.5.t: "Colony Progresses Further"
 chi_moon.5.d: "Our Moon outpost has made another major breakthrough. They have managed to ship Hydrogen 3, a gas which seems perfect for fusion, to Earth, and scientists at home have figured out how to conduct fusion with it! Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surprise, and many at CNSA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase. So, a new Moonbase is needed, in a much better spot for rapid expansion than the current location of Moonbase Alpha. It's time to start preparations on Moonbase Beta."
 chi_moon.5.o1: "Life continues on"

 chi_moon.6.t: "Another Crisis on the Moon"
 chi_moon.6.d: "More drastic measures need to be taken now. Two more modules have ruptured. This time, it's both the Food and Amenities modules.\n\nRoughly forty minutes ago, a scientist was about to enter the Food module when it suddenly exploded. The scientist is fine, and no-one but the plants were harmed. However, it was adjacent to the Amenities module, and it caused it to rupture and explode. Again, no-one was hurt.\n\nThis new occurrence, however, has raised the hairs of many back home, questioning the safety of the modules. After the previous explosion, CNSA replaced the modules, ensuring that they wouldn't explode, but it seems like prolonged pressure can cause something to break much more easily than it would otherwise. CNSA has already quickly responded, ordering new modules be made immediately, as well as a close inspection of all current modules (As you can't \"recall\" modules from the Moon as of this moment).\n\nWith mounting pressure at home to stop going forward with the project until all safety concerns are resolved, the continuation of the Moonbase program comes into question. In addition to the political pushback, the emergency fund has been cut in half, so CNSA is requesting another $5 billion to sort out future concerns. It remains your choice to decide whether to continue."
 chi_moon.6.o1: "Send more emergency aid!"
 chi_moon.6.o2: "We can't continue doing things like this"

 chi_moon.7.t: "Moonbase Beta"
 chi_moon.7.d: "At this point, our scientists and engineers on the Moon need to move to another location on the poles. The costs for doing this are already established in the long-term budget, so we don't need to add any new funding to the project yet.\n\nWith this new moonbase, we will be able to use new discoveries we have uncovered to allow the base to be established permanently, unlike our previous moonbase. With the use of better rockets, better power generation, better ice extraction and separation, we can use this new base, at a site more suited for rapid expansion, to facilitate colonization efforts of the Moon. This is not the only good news, entrepreneurs and corporations are flooding to CNSA en-mass for requests to put their newly developed mining systems on the Moon. Even other space programs in other countries are now extremely interested in starting up scientific and mining outposts on the Moon, however, due to your diligent efforts, we not only have a massive head start, but we are the only country actively attempting to colonize the Moon.\n\nThe future on our Moon is bright and Chinese."

 CHI_Flowing_Spring_desc: "Taking his Chinese Dream to the next level, Xi Jinping has drawn on a poem from the 8th century BCE entitled \"Flowing Spring\" which concerns regaining greatness and prosperity. Rather than a more moderated approach to China's future, the concept of the flowing spring calls upon Chinese citizens to regain their lost greatness and achieve the most they possibly can."
 CHI_Xiaokang_Society: "Xiaokang Society"
 CHI_Xiaokang_Society_desc: "The idea of a moderately prosperous society is not a new one in Chinese politics. Nonetheless, Xi Jinping has decided to give this concept a new lease of life, calling upon the nation to strive for a country that is equally and only moderately well-off."

 CHI_Establish_the_Central_Group_for_Military_Reform_desc: "While a strong institution, the PLA still lags behind the militaries of some of our more advanced rivals. To become a world-class force we should establish a group to formulate possible reforms."
 CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League: "Weaken the Youth League"
 CHI_Weaken_the_Youth_League_desc: "The populist coalition headed by the Tuanpai or Youth League Faction retains significant influence due to the significant degree of independence possessed by the Communist Youth League. By reducing this independence and conducting bribery investigations against Youth League members such as Ling Jihua, we can make the Youth League cease to be an important force in Chinese politics."

 CHI_Take_Down_the_Big_Tigers_desc: "The elitist coalition, dominated by \"princelings\" and Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique, retains a large number of high-ranking posts in the CPC. Luckily for us, a large number of this officials are involved in corruption due to the nepotism of Jiang Zemin's government. This provides the perfect excuse to take these \"big tigers\" down, and with it the power and influence of the Shanghai clique."

 CHI_War_on_Crime: "War on Crime"
 CHI_War_on_Crime_desc: "During his time as Party secretary of Chongqing, Bo Xilai made fighting organized crime one of his top priorities. Now that he can extend his method of governing to the entire country, it is high time that the corrupt businessmen and triad bosses in the rest of the country meet the same fates as their Chongqing-based brethren."
 CHI_The_Chongqing_Model: "The Chongqing Model"
 CHI_The_Chongqing_Model_desc: "The Chongqing Model is Bo Xilai's contribution to Communist Party doctrine. It is a model that includes a wide range of social and economic policies, including \"strike black\" and \"sing red\" campaigns that involve fighting organized crime and singing communist songs respectively. The model also represents a slight departure from China's market liberalization policies."
 CHI_JASIC_Labor_Reforms: "Jasic Labor Reforms"
 CHI_JASIC_Labor_Reforms_desc: "Labor disputes are a significant hinderance to the government's legitimacy. Workers at Jasic Technology in particular have sought to unionize in order to fight for their rights. We should demonstrate our commitment to the workers by possessing a flexible attitude towards Chinese workers, starting with those at Jasic Technology."

 CHI_Red_Culture_Movement: "Red Culture Movement"

 CHI_Humanist_Marxism: "Humanist Marxism"
 CHI_Humanist_Marxism_desc: "The \"New Left\" ideology put forward by Bo Xilai and others is one that favours a return to aspects of Maoist socialism such as state-planning and collectivism. Now that he has come to power, Bo can pursue his leftist agenda under the banner of \"humanist marxism\"."
 CHI_Nanjie_Model: "The Nanjie Model"
 CHI_Nanjie_Model_desc: "In many ways a development of the Chongqing model, the Nanjie model retains many elements of Bo's original theory but draws on the example of Nanjie village, a stronghold of Maoism that retains a collectivist system. Bo's Nanjie model calls on China to heed Nanjie's example, and leave behind capitalism and the free-market in favour of true socialism."
 CHI_Purge_Tuanpai: "Purge the Tuanpai"
 CHI_Purge_Tuanpai_desc: "The Youth League faction, or Tuanpai, has gotten too ambitious and must be cut down to size. It is high time that we purge these so-called populists and replace them with those who better suit our aspirations for China's future."
 CHI_Promote_Princelings: "Promote Princelings"
 CHI_Promote_Princelings_desc: "While the venerable members of Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique have served China well, it is time for them to retire and make way for a new generation of leaders. The princelings, children of China's original revolutionaries, should take the place of both the Tuanpai and the Shanghai clique."
 CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda: "Bo Xilai's Agenda"
 CHI_Bo_Xilai_Agenda_desc: "Following the rise to power of the princelings and the political chaos that followed the purge of the Youth League faction, Bo Xilai has managed to come out on top by distinguishing himself from his fellow princelings with his ardent \"New Left\" ideology. Bo will now be free to pursue his somewhat controversial vision for Chinese politics."
 CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands: "Scrap Military Commands"
 CHI_Scrap_Military_Commands_desc: "The PLA's seven military commands are overly cumbersome and would hinder the ability of different units to coordinate in the event of a large-scale conflict. To remedy this, we should regroup these military commands into five strategic zones: North, South, East,West and Central. However, this change will not come without consequences, as many military officers will resist this disruption."
 CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers: "Cut Ground Troop Numbers"
 CHI_Cut_Ground_Troop_Numbers_desc: "Quantity is not an issue for the PLA, but quality is. Moreover, the PLA Ground Forces dwarf the other arms of the military, meaning we are burdened with an overly landlocked, cumbersome force. In order to make our military more mobile, nimble, and responsive, we should reduce our reliance on the ground forces by cutting troop numbers."
 CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption: "Stamp Out Corruption"
 CHI_Stamp_Out_Corruption_desc: "One of the biggest hurdles to making the PLA a modern military on par with those of the West is corruption. We should use the Central Military Commission to crackdown on any signs of corruption that we can find."
 CHI_Naval_Capability_Enhancements: "Naval Capability Enhancements"
 CHI_Naval_Capability_Enhancements_desc: "Many of the threats we face are maritime in nature. To the East and South lie suspicious neighbours, while all around our sphere of influence, American naval bases bear down on our territorial waters.

 CHI_Aerial_Capability_Enhancements: "Aerial Capability Enhancements"
 CHI_Aerial_Capability_Enhancements_desc: "In the 21st century he who wins the war in the air wins the war on the land and in the sea too. While our aerospace technology is catching up to our geopolitical rivals, we currently lack the air doctrine to match these developments."
 CHI_Network_Centric_Warfare: "Network Centric Warfare"
 CHI_Network_Centric_Warfare_desc: "No longer can we rely on Korean War-era \"human wave\" tactics. We should improve our usage of network-centric warfare if we are to be a serious contender on the battlefields of tomorrow."

 CHI_An_Open_Window: "An Open Window"
 CHI_An_Open_Window_desc: "Deng Xiaoping once famously described the opening up of China as opening a window for fresh air. While, as Deng also said, some \"flies\" are bound to fly in when this happens, this is a risk we must take to enjoy the benefits of openness."

 CHI_Let_a_Hundred_Flowers_Bloom_desc: "In 1956, Mao Zedong initiated the Hundred Flowers Campaign, calling for Chinese citizens to openly air their grievances towards the government. While that campaign ended in repression and a return to the status quo, a reboot of the same campaign does not necessarily have to end the same way."
 CHI_Freedom_of_Speech: "Freedom of Speech"
 CHI_Freedom_of_Speech_desc: "Now that we have allowed our citizens to air their grievances, it has become clear that our society has progressed to the point where such things can be said in public without threatening the stability of the nation. We should proceed with further."
 CHI_Allow_Foreign_Social_Media: "Allow Foreign Social Media"

 CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles: "Question the Four Cardinal Principles"
 CHI_Question_the_Four_Cardinal_Principles_desc: "Deng Xiaoping's Four Cardinal Principles included upholding the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC and Maozedong thought. The inclusion of these principles means that debate about the nature of authoritarian rule in China has not been allowed. If our country is to progress, this should be amended to help diversify debate on China's future."
 CHI_Unchain_the_8_Democratic_Parties: "Unchain the 8 Democratic Parties"
 CHI_Unchain_the_8_Democratic_Parties_desc: "While the Communist Party dominates Chinese politics, 8 other legal parties exist as part of the country's political system. However, up until now they have had little influence over policy and lack an independent voice. The lifting of restrictions on these existing political parties could act as a test to ascertain the viability of establishing multi-party democracy in China."

 CHI_Free_and_Fair_Elections: "Democracy with Chinese Characteristics"
 CHI_Free_and_Fair_Elections_desc: "Democracy as we know it is European in origin. While our recent liberalizations have put us on a path towards adopting Western-style institutions, that does not mean that we have to compromise our traditional cultural values."
 CHI_Support_the_Communists: "Support the Communists"
 CHI_Support_the_Communists_desc: "Even if we have done away with China's one-party rule, that does not mean that the CPC is not the best party to guide China into this new chapter of its history."

 CHI_Support_the_Non_Aligned_Coalition_desc: "China's place is not to pick sides in a world increasingly becoming divided between the West and those who wish to over-turn the existing international order. Instead, we should look to our own interests and seek good relations with both sides."

 CHI_The_Great_Firewall_of_China_desc: "The worldwide web is a dangerous place and we should do our best to protect our citizens from the parts of it which most threaten them. Our new, updated take on China's historic Great Wall, a barrier that protected this country for millennia, will ensure subversive, untrue and divisive content stays out of the sight and mind of the Chinese people."
 CHI_Facial_Recognition_Surveillance: "Facial Recognition Surveillance"

 CHI_Social_Credit_Scheme: "Social Credit Scheme"
 CHI_Social_Credit_Scheme_desc: "As a government, our goal should be to educate our citizens on correct and beneficial behaviour. This will allow our nation to reach its full potential.

 CHI_Skynet: "Skynet"
 CHI_Skynet_desc: "Our citizens' safety is our priority. There are no measures that we should not consider if those measures help us preserve peace, stability, and the rule of law.

 CHI_Industrial_Espionage: "Industrial Espionage"
 CHI_Industrial_Espionage_desc: "Intellectual property is what Western nations use to defend their current economic advantage. Where was intellectual property in the 19th century when Americans violated copyright laws with impunity to achieve economic growth? Why should we behave any differently? Let us use Unit 61398 to close the technological gap between us and our rivals, or even our erstwhile allies."
 CHI_Global_Propaganda_Network: "Global Propaganda Network"
 CHI_Global_Propaganda_Network_desc: "Our influence abroad is growing, but without ample attention this growth will stop. In addition, some political actors in other countries are gaining in strength with dangerous repercussions for our own international position. Unit 61398 can help in both these endeavours."

 CHI_Proper_State_Atheism: "Proper State Atheism"
 CHI_Proper_State_Atheism_desc: "We should conform to Marx's disdain for religion as the opiate of the masses. While we can tolerate a certain degree of private belief, institutionalized religion is undeniably a threat to the authority of the Communist Party. Whether it be against radical Islam or dangerous cults, we should be on our guard."
 CHI_Crush_the_Falun_Gong: "Crush the Falun Gong"
 CHI_Crush_the_Falun_Gong_desc: "While in the past we have tolerated and even to an extent supported Falun Dafa, the cult has grown to a dangerous level and must be crushed."
 CHI_Combat_Islamism: "Combat Islamism"
 CHI_Combat_Islamism_desc: "Islam as a whole is not something we have an issue with. The Hui Muslim minority does not dispute our authority, and as such we grant them room to practise their beliefs. However when it comes to the Uighur Muslims of Xinjiang province, we cannot use the same approach. The East Turkistan Islamic Movement is an Al-Qaeda affiliate and espouses a dangerous ideology of Islamic fundamentalism."
 CHI_Crush_the_Turkistan_Islamic_Party: "Crush the Turkistan Islamic Party"
 CHI_Crush_the_Turkistan_Islamic_Party_desc: "The Turkistan Islamic Party is a new off-shoot of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, one that has continued the radical and violent practices of its predecessor. We should deploy the police and armed forces to hunt down and destroy TIP elements."
 CHI_Xinjiang_Reeducation_Camps: "Xinjiang Re-Education Camps"
 CHI_Xinjiang_Reeducation_Camps_desc: "In order to combat radicalization amongst the Uighur population we have established camps to provide the locals with patriotic and secular teaching.

 CHI_Greater_Freedom_of_Religion: "Greater Freedom of Religion"
 CHI_Greater_Freedom_of_Religion_desc: "While socialism is nominally atheist, we should accept that a substantial proportion of the Chinese population is religious and will remain so. It will suit our long term interest in preserving stability in the country to come to terms with this."
 CHI_Release_the_Falun_Gong: "Rehabilitate the Falun Gong"
 CHI_Release_the_Falun_Gong_desc: "We should put a stop to our recently enacted policy of persecution against Falun Dafa. The policy has caused divisiveness within the country and drawn criticism from external observers."
 CHI_Return_of_the_Dalai_Lama: "Return of the Dalai Lama"
 CHI_Return_of_the_Dalai_Lama_desc: "Tibet has been a source of great concern for our regime in the past few decades. While we have historically dealt with the issue by means of censorship and repression, it may be better for our authority in the province if we were seen to grant concessions to the Tibetan people. One of the greatest concessions we could possibly make is to allow for the return of the Dalai Lama."

 CHI_Declassify_the_Turkistan_Islamic_Party_desc: "While we may be unwilling to negotiate with a terrorist group, we should not let this unwillingness stand in the way of achieving peace. Offering to legitimize the Turkistan Islamic Party as a political force in Xinjiang subject to changes in its ideology and message will go a long way towards reaching that all-important goal of peace."
 CHI_Deescalate_the_Xinjiang_Conflict: "De-Escalate the Xinjiang Conflict"

 CHI_Xinjiang_SAR: "Xinjiang SAR"
 CHI_Xinjiang_SAR_desc: "The time has come to loosen our grip on Xinjiang. It is clear that the long-term stability of the province as well as the surrounding region cannot be secured without a greater degree of local government, under the distant but watchful eye of the capital."
 CHI_One_China_Policy: "One China Policy"
 CHI_One_China_Policy_desc: "As the world's largest country by population and fourth largest by landmass, it is no wonder that there are those who wish for greater degrees of autonomy within our republic. We should consider whether to hold the country together at all costs or to grant space for autonomy within our one China."
 CHI_Two_Systems: "Two Systems"
 CHI_Two_Systems_desc: "While most of China can still conform to our existing form of governance, we should keep to Deng Xiaoping's \"One Country Two Systems\" principle and allow certain parts of China to maintain their own unique political, economic, and legal systems. This approach will reduce opposition to our authority while preserving the integrity of the nation."
 CHI_Extend_Interpretation_of_the_Systems: "Extend Interpretation of the Systems"
 CHI_Extend_Interpretation_of_the_Systems_desc: "\"One Country Two Systems\" was originally formulated to facilitate the return of Macau and Hong Kong to Chinese rule, the principle has the potential to be applied to other cases if we allow for more extensive interpretations of it."

 CHI_Consider_Electoral_Reform_in_Hong_Kong_desc: "Given the strong pressure in Hong Kong for reforms of the means by which Legislative Council representatives and the Chief Executive are elected, we should consider whether to make concessions to the people of Hong Kong in this particular area, or whether to rule out universal suffrage once and for all."
 CHI_The_NPCSC_Decision_on_Hong_Kong: "The NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong"
 CHI_The_NPCSC_Decision_on_Hong_Kong_desc: "China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has a decision to make regarding the extent of electoral reform we can grant Hong Kong. Giving the S.A.R. universal suffrage will appease the democracy movement's demands but increase the risk of an anti-Chinese or separatist leader gaining control of Hong Kong while refusing universal suffrage could lead to mass protests."
 CHI_Hong_Kong_Future: "Hong Kong's Future"
 CHI_Hong_Kong_Future_desc: "We have so far made no indication as to the fate of Hong Kong when the Basic Law preserving its current autonomy expires in 2047. It may be in our interest to do so now as promising a continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy could help convince Taiwan to return to our control. However, we might want to quash separatism by demonstrating the strength of our commitment to Chinese sovereignty."
 CHI_Greater_Tibetan_Autonomy: "Greater Tibetan Autonomy"
 CHI_Greater_Tibetan_Autonomy_desc: "Tibet is a region with a unique cultural and religious identity. While we must continue to regard it as an integral part of the Chinese nation, it may serve our purposes to grant a greater degree of self-rule to the Tibetans than they currently possess."
 CHI_Tibet_SAR: "Tibet SAR"

 CHI_Dialogue_with_the_Taiwan_Self_Government: "Dialogue with the Taiwan authorities"
 CHI_Dialogue_with_the_Taiwan_Self_Government_desc: "Even if we may not agree with Taiwan's right to its current political autonomy, it nonetheless possesses it. The most pragmatic course of action is to negotiate with the Taiwanese and reduce tensions between our two parties."
 CHI_Three_Links: "Three Links"
 CHI_Three_Links_desc: "Postal, transport, and trade links between the island of Taiwan and the mainland do not currently exist, with all cross-strait business having to be rerouted through intermediaries like Hong Kong and Jeju.

 CHI_Propose_Roadmap_to_Reunification_desc: "Now that our relations with the so-called Taiwanese government have improved, we can offer to facilitate a gradual re-integration of the island into the P.R.C. as a Special Administrative Region. If the Taiwanese accept our proposal then we may continue with our diplomatic efforts, but if they do not we may have to resort to other means to return Taiwan to our control."
 CHI_Drop_Opposition_to_Taiwanese_Independence: "Drop Opposition to Independence"
 CHI_Drop_Opposition_to_Taiwanese_Independence_desc: "While in the past we have expressed an intent to prevent Taiwanese independence at all costs, we must now come to realize that belligerence towards Taiwan may suit our purposes less than a more pragmatic approach. By demonstrating our willingness to accommodate the wishes of the Taiwanese people, whatever they may be, we will significantly reduce their hostility to us."

 CHI_Sign_an_Armistice: "Sign an Armistice"

 CHI_Recognize_an_Independent_Taiwan_desc: "We should accept that the prospect of reintegrating Taiwan into China is unrealistic at this point, given the high support in the country for independence. However, if we cut our losses now and amend our policy towards Taiwan we will still be able to keep Taiwan within our sphere of influence. A good first step will be to recognize their sovereignty."

 CHI_Anti_Japanese_Communique_desc: "While the West has grown complacent regarding the threat posed by the Japanese nation, we have no such illusions.

Now that our links to Taiwan have been strengthened we can issue a joint condemnation of Japan."
 CHI_Back_a_Coup: "Back a Coup"
 CHI_Back_a_Coup_desc: "The Taiwanese have rejected our generous offer and we therefore have no choice but to resort to more aggressive measures.

 CHI_Gain_Support_of_Military_Elements_desc: "In order for a coup to succeed we cannot rely on the individual loyalty of Taiwanese officers to the cause of reunification alone, as strong as this sentiment may be.

 CHI_Demand_Vietnams_Submission_desc: "For thousands of years Vietnam has sent tribute to China in recognition of our superiority over them.

 CHI_Criticize_the_American_Presence_desc: "The existence of American troops in our sphere of influence is an insult and cannot be tolerated!

 CHI_Demand_a_Withdrawal: "Demand a Withdrawal"
 CHI_Demand_a_Withdrawal_desc: "An American withdrawal will remove a substantial threat to our security as well as open up the way to the restoration of a unified Korea under the DPRK. The Americans are more likely to bow to our demands if we have already undermined their global influence."

 CHI_Mediate_Korean_Peace_Talks: "Mediate Korean Peace Talks"
 CHI_Mediate_Korean_Peace_Talks_desc: "For too long the Korean peninsula has existed in a frozen state of war. Tensions between North and South Korea exist due to mutual suspicion and distrust over defensive actions that are misconstrued as offensive ones.

 CHI_Back_Peaceful_Korean_Unification: "Back Peaceful Korean Unification"
 CHI_Back_Peaceful_Korean_Unification_desc: "We should express our support for the eventual reunification of the Korean peninsula under a non-aligned government free of external influence. Whether this eventuality comes to pass is down to the Koreans."

 CHI_Doklam_Road_Standoff: "Doklam Road Standoff"
 CHI_Doklam_Road_Standoff_desc: "Doklam is Chinese territory, and we should therefore be able to move troops and construction equipment through it freely if we so wish. If Bhutan and India wish to respond, let them. This will be a good opportunity to test their combat readiness."

 CHI_The_Quadrilateral_Cooperation_and_Coordination_Mechanism_desc: "The Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism or QCCM will be a useful grouping of four countries with a shared interest in combating terrorism. Hopefully it will also improve tense relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan and help spread our influence in Russian-dominated Central Asia through our Tajik partners."

 CHI_Disengage_from_Pakistan_desc: "It is time to re-evaluate our approach towards the Indian subcontinent.

 CHI_String_of_Pearls: "String of Pearls"
 CHI_String_of_Pearls_desc: "India's dominance over the Indian Ocean is an undesirable state of affairs. We can seek to contain India much in the same way as America is seeking to contain us, namely by encircling our rival with military bases located in the territory of our regional partners. This encirclement will give us a significant advantage should we enter a state of war with India."
 CHI_Annex_Bhutan: "Annex Bhutan"
 CHI_Annex_Bhutan_desc: "Our claims over Bhutan may not extend over the country's entire territory, but the country's close historical ties to Tibet should provide reasonable justification for our desire to integrate Bhutan into the Tibet Autonomous Region.

 CHI_Puppet_Nepal: "Puppet Nepal"
 CHI_Puppet_Nepal_desc: "Some political forces in Nepal are willing to significantly strengthen their country's ties to China at the expense of its partnership with India.

 arunachal_war_decisions_category_desc: "The Arunachal conflict refers to a territorial dispute between India and China over a region called Arunachal, China calls it South Tibet,located in the southeast part of the Tibetan Plateau. The conflict dates back to the 1950s when both countries gained independence and inherited border issues from their colonial past. Arunachal is located on the southern slope of the eastern section of the Himalaya Mountains. Affected by the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean, it has heavy rainfall, is warm and humid all year round, and has superior water and heat conditions. However, it holds immense importance for both India and China in terms of strategic military control and access to resources. Border conflict on China-Indian border spans for decades. To manage possible gains we need to keep our readiness high, increase tension for escalating border conflicts and be ready for our enemy to do the same. \n\n§YOur readiness:§!
