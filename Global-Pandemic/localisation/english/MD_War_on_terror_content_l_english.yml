 usa_increase_intelligence_spending_desc: "We have scattered reports of an oncoming serious terrorist attack. We currently don't have the tools to combat this threat properly.

Such a location would ideally be on an island that also harbors a hostile government closely watching the border to our territory, and thankfully such an arrangement precisely exists on the island of Cuba, where the United States holds a lease (which is no longer recognized by the Cuban government) on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base area since 1903, a lease that was then indefinitely extended in 1934.\n\nAlso, another upside of this location is that Guantanamo Bay is neither a state nor even a U.S. territory, meaning that U.S. law and even the U.S. constitution do not necessarily apply there.

 wot.2.t: "Major Terrorist Attack on the East Coast"
 wot.2.da: "We have received reports of an attempted terrorist attack on the East Coast. Early morning today, several suspected Al-Qaeda members were arrested at the Logan International Airport in Boston and the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C.. Despite these early warnings, five terrorists manage to board Flight 93 at the Newark International Airport in New York. As they tried to hijack the flight, resistance from passengers eventually led to them crashing the plane into a field in Stonycreek Township in Pennsylvania. The crew of seven and 33 passengers and the five hijackers were all killed in the crash.\n\nBased on our current intelligence, the planes were intended to be crashed to several targets on the East Coast, including the World Trade Center, Pentagon and the Capitol building.\n\nFortunately our intelligence services were on the lookout, and we managed to prevent a terrible tragedy."
 wot.2.db: "We have received reports of a major terrorist attack on the East Coast. The hijackers, most likely members of Al-Qaeda, used the commercial airliners American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines Flight 93 as flying bombs against the United States. \n\nEarly morning today, at 8:46 AM, Flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, shortly followed by Flight 175 hitting the South Tower at 9:3 AM. At 9:37 AM, Flight 77 hit the Pentagon in Washington D.C.. The fourth plane, Flight 93, which was presumably headed towards the Capitol, crashed at 10:3 AM as the passengers tried to retake it from the hijackers.\n\nOur nation has to recover from a horrifying day. The political situation is completely different from what it was yesterday."

The terrorists managed to keep the plane in the air and eventually crashed it into the side of the Capitol building at 10:23.\n\nOur nation has to recover from a horrifying day. The political situation is completely different from what it was yesterday."
 wot.2.a: "We will honor the sacrifice of Flight 93"
 wot.2.b: "Oh the humanity!"
 wot.2.c: "Oh the humanity!"
 wot.3.t: "Diplomatic Response to the World Trade Center Attacks"
 wot.3.d: "The United States of America was deliberately and suddenly attacked by enemy terrorist combatants.\n\nAs the United States is preparing for its diplomatic and military response to the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the [Root.GetAdjective] foreign minister is increasingly pushing for the government to release a firm and decisive statement on the matter."
 wot.3.a: "We stand with America! No matter what!"
 wot.3.b: "Condemn the attacks, but don't make promises."
 wot.3.c: "This is what happens when you interfere with other countries."
 wot.4.t: "Local politician backs the government"
 wot.4.da: "As the Republican administration is scrambling to find a decisive response to the recent terrorist attack, the Democratic Party has so far stood by and more or less observed the situation, making statements of condemnation against the attackers but no certain political promises or demands.\n\nNow, a major member of the Democratic Party from the affected state, New York, has taken up a central position in the reactions to the attacks: Hillary Clinton, Senator from New York and former First Lady of the United States, has held a clear speech: \"Every nation has to either be with us, or against us. Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.\".\n\nThe Democrats up and down the country have begun rallying around Clinton's statements, signaling not only solidarity with their senator but also with the Republican administration to proceed and to take up any means necessary to find a proper answer to this not only atrocious, but fundamentally anti-American attack."

Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.\".\n\nThe Republicans up and down the country have begun rallying around Giuliani's statements, signaling not only solidarity with the mayor but also with the Democrat administration to proceed and to take up any means necessary to find a proper answer to this not only atrocious, but fundamentally anti-American attack."

 wot.4.b: "They're only trying to benefit from a tragedy!"
 wot.5.t: "National Prayer Service"
 wot.5.d: "A National Prayer Service has been suggested to be held at the Washington National Cathedral for the victims of the terrorist attacks. Several former Presidents of the United States will be present along with the incumbent one and with religious leaders from several faiths, including various branches of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism.\n\n[USA.GetLeader] will hold the central speech of the memorial service."
 wot.5.a: "This is an important service"
 wot.5.b: "We don't need this to remember the victims"
 wot.6.t: "Murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi"
 wot.6.d: "As a direct result of the terrorist attacks, islamophobic sentiment and violence across the United States increased dramatically - but most of the attacks stayed at racially or religiously charged verbal abuse, theft or damage of property. Not so with Balbir Singh Sodhi.\n\nThe Indian-born Sikh was mistakenly identified as Muslim (because of his middle eastern complexion and his turban) by 42-year-old Frank Silva Roque at Singh's gas station in Mesa, Arizona. Singh was subsequently shot dead by Roque from his truck with a .380 handgun. Roque fled the scene and, twenty minutes later, tried to kill another person, a Lebanon-born store clerk .\nAfter failing at this assassination attempt, Roque ended his terror spree at his own former residence, now taken up by an Afghan family, firing shots at the building but causing no casualties. He would be arrested the following day and eventually sentenced to death for first degree murder."
 wot.6.a: "We will never surrender to terrorists! No matter the skin color!"
 wot.6.b: "It was an understandable misunderstanding"
 wot.7.t: "Anthrax Attacks"
 wot.7.d: "The anthrax attacks, also known as Amerithrax from its FBI case name, began shortly after the terrorist attack.\n\nLetters containing anthrax spores were sent to multiple individuals, including news reporters and two U.S. senators. The incident of bio-terrorism is thought to be connected to the terrorist attack on the East Coast (but the ongoing FBI investigation has not found conclusive evidence yet) and has so far killed 5 people and injured 17 more."
 wot.7.a: "All obstacles we will overcome"
 wot.7.b: "We must find the ones who did this!"
 wot.8.t: "The War on Terror Speech"
 wot.8.d: "[USA.GetLeader] held a speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, declaring a, as he calls it, \"War on Terror\".\n\nThe President promised resolute and straight reactions to terror and famously made the following address to all other countries of the world: \"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.\""
 wot.8.a: "Justice we shall bring"
 wot.8.b: "And it shall be swift"
 wot.9.t: "US Demands Extradition of Osama bin Laden"
 wot.9.d: "After the terror attack on the East Coast, the US has contacted our officials and they are demanding that we sever all links to our allies the Al-Qaeda and their leader Osama bin Laden. We also have to capture bin Laden and deliver him to the hands of the US. Based on the previous rhetoric, declining the request will surely turn the US into our enemy."
 wot.9.a: "The Great Satan will have nothing!"
 wot.9.b: "Maybe a deal with the devil is necessary..."
 wot.10.t: "Taliban Refuse Extradition"
 wot.10.d: "The Taliban have refused to stop cooperating with Al-Qaeda and bin Laden. It seems that the only way for us to get criminals to court is to topple the entire Taliban regime."
 wot.10.a: "This wasn't a surprising outcome"
 wot.11.t: "Taliban Agree on Extradition"
 wot.11.d: "Surprisingly, the Taliban have agreed to kick out Al-Qaeda from the country, and hunt down bin Laden. They said that they are willing to cooperate with the US military to bring terrorists to justice. We have already dispatched a special forces group to apprehend bin Laden in his last known location"
 wot.11.a: "This is...odd"
 wot.12.t: "US Requests Help With Taliban"
 wot.12.d: "The United States is going to drive out the Taliban out of Afghanistan. They have requested our support in the fight."
 wot.12.a: "We will send soldiers to the fight!"
 wot.12.b: "We will arm the local militias!"
 wot.12.c: "We will provide moral support! Go Team!"
 wot.13.t: "Choosing a Candidate"
 wot.13.da: "We need to make a decision on who we should recommend as the ruler of Afghanistan. It is likely that the current local government of Afghanistan will go along with our recommendation. We have four good candidates to choose from.\n\nOur options are Hamid Karzai, who joined the Northern Alliance after his father was assassinated by Al-Qaeda, Burhanuddin Rabbani, the current official president of Afghanistan and the leader of the conservative Islamist Jamiat party, Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Lion of Pajnshir, or the exiled king of Afghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah."

 wot.13.b: "Burhanuddin Rabbani"
 wot.13.c: "Ahmad Shah Massoud"
 wot.13.d: "Mohammed Zahir Shah"
 wot.14.t: "US Petitions Invasion of Iraq"
 wot.14.d: "The US has brought forward a suggestion to justify an invasion of Iraq. The US claims that Saddam Hussein is a threat to the Iraqi people, peace in the region and that Iraq also own weapons of mass destruction. None of the UN inspectors have found these weapons, but the US still holds on to these claims."
 wot.14.a: "We vote yes"
 wot.14.b: "We vote no"
 wot.15.t: "Petition Denied"
 wot.15.d: "The UN has denied our petition to invade Iraq."
 wot.15.a: "Go forward with the invasion anyway"
 wot.15.b: "I guess we'll have to listen to them..."
 wot.16.t: "Petition Approved"
 wot.16.d: "The UN has approved our petition to invade Iraq."
 wot.16.a: "Magnificent!"
 wot.17.t: "Joining the Invasion of Iraq?"

 wot.17.a: "Of course we'll help our allies!"
 wot.17.b: "This is an unjust war"
 wot.20.t: "Osama bin Laden Evades Capture"
 wot.20.d: "Our operation to capture bin Laden has been a total failure. By the time our forces arrived to his suspected compound, bin Laden was long gone. It is likely that forces sympathetic to him tipped him off of our operation, giving him ample time to escape.\n\nSo far, we don't have intelligence on where he escaped, but most likely he is already on his way out of Afghanistan."
 wot.20.a: "We'll get him next time"
 wot.21.t: "Osama bin Laden Captured"
 wot.21.d: "Our special forces managed to capture Osama bin Laden in his hideout in Afghanistan. With help from local Taliban informants, we were able to pinpoint his exact location, and he surrendered without a fight."
 wot.21.a: "Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him"
 wot.22.t: "Osama bin Laden's hideout found"
 wot.22.d: "Our intelligence services have located the new hideout of Osama bin Laden. We have identified a compound in [event_target:hideout_of_bin_laden.GetNameDef]. From drone footage and based on local sources, this is definitely the location of bin Laden. We should inform [event_target:hideout_of_bin_laden.GetAdjective] government right away and ask their permission to perform a special operations mission to take out bin Laden"
 wot.22.a: "Contact the host country right away!"
 wot.22.b: "Who cares about one terrorist?"
 wot.23.t: "The United States Detects bin Laden"
 wot.23.d: "Today the foreign secretary of the United States contacted us and informed us that they have found a hiding place of Osama bin Laden in our country. Osama bin Laden, a leader of Al-Qaeda, is responsible for the large terror attack on the United States a few years back. Our own intelligence services have been able to verify and double-check some of the information the US has provided us. It is very likely that bin Laden indeed is residing in a secret location in our country.\n\nAllowing the US to do this operation will be a large hit against global terrorism, but allowing foreign special forces to operate in our country is risky. Then again, bin Laden is one of the most sought terrorists in the world and denying the US access will probably not go well with the United States"
 wot.23.a: "Allow the operation"
 wot.23.b: "We will not allow the US compromise our sovereignty!"
 wot.24.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees to Operation"
 wot.24.d: "[FROM.GetName] has given our special forces permission to enter their country and conduct a raid against bin Laden's hideout. We should get results of the operation in a few days."
 wot.24.a: "Great!"
 wot.25.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects Our Request!"
 wot.25.d: "After many attempts to gain [FROM.GetName]'s permission to conduct an on the grounds search for bin Laden, [FROM.GetLeader] has sent back a simple response; "No". Some are calling for harsh punishments for [FROM.GetName] for blatantly ignoring our call to aid us in the war on terror, we could let it slide however, as unpopular as it may be at home..."
 wot.25.a: "I suppose their sovereignty should be respected."
 wot.25.b: "How long can they go without us and our aid?"

The strike comes just days after Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein defied a 48-hour deadline to leave the country.

 wotnews.14.t: "US Withdraws Troops From Iraq"
 wotnews.14.d: "The last convoy of U.S. soldiers pulled out of Iraq, ending nearly nine years of war that inflicted many casualties on both sides, and left a country grappling with political uncertainty. The final column of around 100 mostly U.S. military MRAP armoured vehicles carrying 500 U.S. troops trundled across the southern Iraq desert from their last base through the night and daybreak along an empty highway to the Kuwaiti border. For the United States, the military pullout is the fulfilment of a promise to bring troops home from a conflict, widely considered the most unpopular war since Vietnam and one that tainted America’s standing worldwide. For Iraqis, though, the departure brings a sense of sovereignty tempered by nagging fears their country may slide once again into the kind of sectarian violence that killed many thousands of people at its peak in 2006-2007."
