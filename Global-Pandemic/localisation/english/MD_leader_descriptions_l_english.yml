 JIANG_ZEMIN_LEADER_DESC: "Jiang Zemin (born August 17, 1926) is a former engineer who has led the Communist Party since 1989, replacing the reformist Zhao Ziyang in the wake of the Tienanmen Square protests. Previously he served as mayor of Shanghai and his continued favoring of individuals who served with him in Shanghai has led to his faction of the party being dubbed the "Shanghai Clique". An advocate of economic reform, his rule in the 1990s has seen a continuation of Deng Xiaoping's policy of reform and opening up and a normalizing of the private sector. He has also presided over the return of both Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereign and has faced criticism over his heavy-handed approach to human rights."

 KIM_DAE_JUNG_LEADER_DESC: "Kim Dae-jung (born January 6, 1924) is a well-respected figure in South Korean politics due to his long history of pro-democracy activism, with some referring to him as "the Nelson Mandela of Asia". Having survived a suspected assassination attempt, kidnapping by intelligence agents, as well as a death sentence, Kim has finally emerged from almost 50 years of opposition to lead his country. His priorities since he took office in 1998 have included economic recovery, holding Korea's powerful chaebols to account, and engaging with North Korea under his trademark Sunshine Policy."
 ROH_MOO_HYUN_LEADER_DESC: "Roh Moo-hyun (born August 6, 1946) is a former human rights lawyer from a poor background who defended student protestors against the authoritarian regime. Much like Kim Dae-jung, who has supported his presidency, Roh favors negotiations with the North rather than a policy of international isolation. He has also been openly critical of the United States and Japan, and has an antagonistic relationship with Korea's conservative establishment. Roh derives his support from the left-leaning "386 generation" who are in their 30s, went to college in the 80s, and were born in the 60s."
 LEE_MYUNG_BAK_LEADER_DESC: "Lee Myung-bak (born December 19, 1941) is a conservative politician and former CEO of Hyundai. During his time at Hyundai, he earned the nickname "Raging Bulldozer" in part due to his strict management approach. An ambitious figure, Lee hopes to transform Korea into one of the world's largest economies and promote an internationalist foreign policy that will elevate Korea's global status. In contrast to his left-wing counterparts, Lee favors a hardline approach to North Korea and a close partnership with the United States."
 PARK_GEUN_HYE_LEADER_DESC: "Park Geun-hye (born February 2, 1952) is best known for being the daughter of Park Chung-hee, Korea's former authoritarian leader who continues to have a controversial legacy. While some view Park Chung-hee as a brutal dictator who used torture and imprisonment to preserve his rule, others praise him for his economic achievements. In her youth, Park survived the assassination of both her mother and father, the former at the hands of a North Korean agent and the latter at the hands of the head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Known for her conservative, market-oriented stance, Park favours deregulation, cutting taxes, and law and order."
 MOON_JAE_IN_LEADER_DESC: "Moon Jae-in (born January 24, 1953) is the son of North Korean refugees and a former human rights lawyer and activist. During his military service, Moon served as a special forces commando and took part in Operation Paul Bunyan, the ROK-USA joint response to the 1976 Panmunjon axe murder incident. A close friend of his predecessor Roh Moo-hyun, whom he had previously started a legal practice with, Moon was active in Roh's left-wing administration and was an important player in the Sunshine Policy, which he remains committed to. While committed to the US alliance, Moon has stated that Korea should learn how to say no to the Americans and hopes to take back wartime control of the Korean military from the US."
 ### NORTH KOREA ###
 KIM_JONG_UN_LEADER_DESC: "Kim Jong-un (born January 8, 1984) was the son most valued by Kim Jong-il during his lifetime. During his days studying in Switzerland, his slightly obese frame made it possible to underestimate him. But when he did ascend to the throne, he shocked the world with his calmness, shrewdness and ruthlessness in the secret executions of his political enemies (including, according to unconfirmed reports, the execution of his paternal uncle with anti-aircraft guns), his determination to continue developing nuclear weapons despite international sanctions, and he catch precise timing of the friendly dialogue with the US and South Korea. Under his leadership as a \"great man from heaven\", perhaps there is a real possibility of North Korea becoming the \"Strong and Prosperous Nation\"?"
 KIM_JONG_NAM_LEADER_DESC: "Kim Jong-nam, (born May 10, 1971), is the son of Kim Jong-il and his second wife. As the eldest son of his family, Kim Jong-nam witnessed the misery of the people under the \"Arduous March\". During his time abroad, he saw the rapid development of China's reform and opening up, and was impressed by the power of change. He believed that only reform could bring material prosperity and spiritual happiness to the North Korean people, but he also understood that change could cost him his power. But he never regretted it."
 KIM_YO_JONG_LEADER_DESC: "Kim Yo-jong (born September 26, 1987), as the only girl in her family, has shown such talent since she began her political career that Kim Jong-il exclaimed when choosing his successor: \"If only Kim Yo-jong were a boy\". Perhaps because of her feminine image, she (peculiarly) enjoys a high level of support both at home and abroad. Today, her reign is proving that women can do just as well as men, no matter what kind of country's politics."

 POLITICS_PAUL_KAGAME_DESC: "When Paul Kagame was 28, he helped topple the government of Uganda. At 36, he overthrew the genocidal Hutu-led government of Rwanda. At 39, he ousted Mobutu of DR Congo, Africa's most corrupt and repressive dictator. Kagame is probably the most successful military leader alive, having won more wars than anyone - all on a shoestring budget. While repressing all opposition at home, the Tutsi general is constantly fixing his eyes on further foreign ambitions, hunting down Hutu rebels and exploiting mineral riches."
