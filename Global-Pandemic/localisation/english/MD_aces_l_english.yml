 MD_ace_promoted.1.t: "Ace Pilot Promoted"
 MD_ace_promoted.1.d: "Few take as many risks as the brave pilots of the [Root.GetAdjective] air force. [From.GetName] [From.GetSurname], a skilled pilot known under the callsign [From.GetCallsign], has distinguished [From.GetHerselfHimself] in not only returning alive, but piloting [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetWing] with immense skill. Recently, [From.GetName] was on a mission over [From.GetMissionRegion] and was instrumental to the success of this critical encounter.\n\nHeld up as a shining example of [Root.GetAdjective] courage, [From.GetName]'s recent promotion has been highly publicized. Although the people may view war as more hell than glory, many are glad to see that there are still heroes to rally behind."
 MD_ace_promoted.1.a: "Who dares, wins."
 MD_ace_died.1.t: "[From.GetCallsign] Killed Over [From.GetMissionRegion]"
 MD_ace_died.1.d: "One of [From.Owner.GetName]'s most famous [From.GetAceType] aces, [From.GetFullName], has gone down in the line of duty. Pilots returning from the mission report having spotted [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetWingShort] going down in flames over [From.GetMissionRegion] after taking heavy enemy fire. Unfortunately, since [From.GetSheHe] has long since been a public figure, the demise of [From.GetCallsign] is severely demoralizing to the many people who looked up to [From.GetHerHim].\n\nWhile we wish there was a way to hide this event from the people, the lack of public appearances from [From.GetName] would soon raise suspicion. Ultimately, [From.GetHerHis] death is another part of a legend that will hopefully live on long past our current troubles."
 MD_ace_died.1.a: "A living legend is still better."
 MD_ace_killed_by_ace.1.t: "[From.GetFullName] Shot Down By [Prev.GetCallsign]"
 MD_ace_killed_by_ace.1.d: "Pilots returning from [From.GetMissionRegion] report that, a squadron of [Prev.Owner.GetAdjective] aircraft led by the infamous [Prev.GetCallsign] focused on chasing down [From.GetCallsign]. After taking down a number of enemy aircraft and dodging several missiles from the [Prev.Owner.GetAdjective]s, [From.GetCallsign] was overwhelmed by [Prev.GetCallsign] in his [Prev.GetWingShort], who reportedly outmaneuvered [From.GetHerHim] and ripped the fuel tanks open with a clean hit. [From.GetName] [From.GetSurname]'s [From.GetWingShort] caught fire and went spiraling down over [From.GetMissionRegion] in a violent inferno.\n\n[From.GetFullName] has shown great courage throughout [From.GetHerHis] service and was looked up to by many. The loss of this national hero is a great blow to the [From.Owner.GetAdjective] air force and is a devastating blow nation as a whole. Knowing that while we grieve, [Prev.Owner.GetName] is celebrating [Prev.GetFullName] as a hero, makes the tragedy even greater."
 MD_ace_killed_by_ace.1.a: "A devastating loss for us all"
 MD_ace_killed_other_ace.1.t: "[From.GetFullName] Shot Down [Prev.GetCallsign]"
 MD_ace_killed_other_ace.1.d: "Our latest mission over [From.GetMissionRegion] was a great success for the [From.Owner.GetAdjective] air force in more than one aspect. Reports have come in highlighting [From.GetFullName]'s heroic deed, managing to outwit the [Prev.Owner.GetAdjective] pilot, [Prev.GetName] [Prev.GetSurname], known as [Prev.GetCallsign]. [From.GetCallsign] used [From.GetHerselfHimself] as bait and lured [Prev.GetCallsign] into a trap where the [From.Owner.GetAdjective] pilots were able to dive on [Prev.GetCallsign]'s squadron. [From.GetCallsign] proceeded to outmaneuver the [Prev.Owner.GetAdjective] aircraft and with a single missile sent [Prev.GetCallsign] spiraling from the skies of [From.GetMissionRegion].\n\n[Prev.GetFullName] was a feared pilot with many [From.Owner.GetAdjective] lives on [Prev.GetHerHis] conscience. This is a great victory and shows that when we rally behind great heroes, they perform great deeds."
 MD_ace_killed_other_ace.1.a: "A victory all of [From.Owner.GetName] will remember!"
 MD_aces_killed_each_other.1.t: "[From.GetFullName] has gone down"
 MD_aces_killed_each_other.1.d: "During the latest mission our famous [From.GetAceType] ace [From.GetFullname] ended up in a prolonged fight with the feared ace pilot, [Prev.GetFullName]. Being low on munitions and with no possibility of escape, [From.GetCallsign] maneuvered [From.GetHerHis] [From.GetWingShort] through the fire from the [Prev.Owner.GetAdjective] aircraft and proceeded to ram [Prev.GetCallsign].\nBoth [From.GetCallsign]'s [From.GetWingShort] and [Prev.GetCallsign]'s [Prev.GetWingShort] were spotted going down in pieces over [From.GetMissionRegion].\n\nWhile it is a small consolation that the [Prev.Owner.GetAdjective] menace, [Prev.GetCallsign], will no longer be a nuisance to us, we have lost a valued public figure and inspiration to all [From.Owner.GetAdjective]."
 MD_aces_killed_each_other.1.a: "A great loss for us nonetheless"
