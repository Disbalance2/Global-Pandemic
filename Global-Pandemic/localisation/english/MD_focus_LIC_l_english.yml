 Liechtenstein.3.t: "The United States Accepts Our Offer!"
 Liechtenstein.3.d: "The US has decided that the large price we've offered to pay is worth it, and has decided to accept our offer to purchase the state of Alaska."
 Liechtenstein.3.a: "Now to sort out how this will fit into this year's budget..."
 Liechtenstein.4.t: "The United States Gives Us Alaska For Free!"
 Liechtenstein.4.d: "The United States, for whatever reason, has declined our offer of payment and instead wishes to give us Alaska for free!"
 Liechtenstein.4.a: "Wait, what?"
 Liechtenstein.5.t: "The United States Sells Alaska to Liechtenstein"
 Liechtenstein.5.d: "The United States has agreed to sell the former state of Alaska to The Principality of Liechtenstein. Whether due to financial desperation or incompetence we're not sure, but it's happened all the same."

 Liechtenstein.7.t: "The Throne of the Holy Roman Empire"

 Liechtenstein.7.b: "This is a serious threat to the international community. We must prepare!"

 LIC_HRE_modern_empire_desc: "The old Holy Roman Empire was a paragon of weakness and instability. No Longer. Liechtenstein reformed the Empire from a place of strength, and it is now time for us to assert our will upon our subjects."
 LIC_formed_HRE_tt: "Have Formed the Holy Roman Empire"
 LIC_HRE_modern_empire_tt: "Begin to fix your crumbling and decentralized domain"
 LIC_HRE_stabilize: "Stabilize the Empire"
 LIC_HRE_stabilize_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire, while mostly German, is made up of dozens of cultures and ethnicities, all brought to heel by the might of our Empire. We may be able to control them for now, but if we wish for this fledgling Empire to survive and thrive, we must first look inwards to keep our structure from shattering."
 LIC_HRE_centralize: "Centralize the Empire"
 LIC_HRE_centralize_desc: "Our new Empire has been formed with a similar structure to the last — this was necessary in order to lay claims to our rightful throne. But now that the Hapsburgs are no longer in charge, their inefficient administration can no longer guide the course of our nation. It is time to centralize economic power with the Emperor, once and for all."
 LIC_HRE_organize: "Organize the Empire"
 LIC_HRE_organize_desc: "Our armies, though large, are diverse and disjointed. Made almost entirely of new conscripts using the weapons of subjugated nations, our military is the epitome of chaos. If we're to ensure our future as a nation, we'll need to spend considerable time and effort reorganizing our military."
 LIC_idea_HRE_government: "Disjointed Empire"
 LIC_idea_HRE_government_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is only by the most liberal of definitions a functioning state. If the new Empire wishes to survive, it must address its myriad internal issues."

 LIC_idea_HRE_centralized: "Destabilized and Disorganized Empire"
 LIC_idea_HRE_centralized_desc: "Though the new Emperor has succeeded in centralizing power in Vaduz, internal strife and a disorganized military still pose a major obstacle to the longevity of the Empire."
 LIC_idea_HRE_centralized_organized: "Destabilized Empire"
 LIC_idea_HRE_centralized_organized_desc: "With the armies reformed and the power centralized, the new Emperor needs only to address our internal conflict to ensure a prosperous future for the Empire."
 LIC_idea_HRE_centralized_stabilized: "Disorganized Empire"
 LIC_idea_HRE_centralized_stabilized_desc: "With power centralized in Vaduz and internal opposition quelled, the Holy Roman Emperor has only one more major challenge ahead before he will be ready to join international politics as a major player: the armed forces."
 LIC_idea_HRE_stabilized_organized: "Decentralized Empire"
 LIC_idea_HRE_stabilized_organized_desc: "Now that domestic opposition has been neutralized and the military has been reorganized in the service of their new Emperor, there remains only the natural last step; centralize the power of the nation in the throne."
