 education.1.d: "Our prudent education funding and expertly managed curriculums have seemingly paid off, with a literacy rate above 95%, we can now call ourselves a highly educated and well learned society with little resistance from those naysayer, both within and outwith the nation's borders. In achieving this monumental goal, we will no longer receive annual reports on our nation's literacy rates."
 education.1.A: "Do I still get my daily apple?"

 education.2.t: "Education Minister Reports Faltering Literacy Rates!"
 education.2.d: "Despite our best efforts, our literacy rates seem to have fallen, whether it be due to wavering support towards keeping the education system well funded or a massive influx of less literate peoples is anyone's guess, we will once more receive annual reports on our nation's literacy rates."
 education.2.A: "Where are my alphabet books?"

 education_literacy_pulse.1.t: "School's Out For Summer!"
 education_literacy_pulse.1.d: "While school is out for Summer, we certainly hope our students salute the flag, no matter how bad the drag. The reports are in and our students' exams have been tallied, no matter what happens, let's hope they make themselves useful, shall we?"
