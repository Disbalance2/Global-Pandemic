## TANK MODULES ##

 tank_base_tank_turret: "Welded Turret"
 tank_base_tank_turret_desc: "A blocky Western-style turret made of welded armour plates. While expensive to manufacture and large in size, the flat surfaces allow for easier application of composite and reactive armour\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is a balanced tank turret for both offence and defence. Use this if you value high survivability and quality over quantity for your tanks§!"
 tank_soviet_turret: "Cast Turret"
 tank_soviet_turret_desc: "A Soviet-style pan-shaped cast turret. A cast turret is cheap to manufacture and it allows the creation of a low and curved turret profile. However, this round shape makes it more difficult to utilise reactive armour and hard-to-cast composite materials.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is a balanced tank turret for both offence and defence. Use this if you need a large amount of tanks and can live with favouring quantity over quality§!"
 tank_no_turret: "No Turret"
 tank_no_turret_desc: "An unorthodox design most often seen in the Swedish Stridsvagn-series, this tank is built without a turret. The gun is fixed into the hull, allowing a sleek and low profile that provides a mobile, defensive gun platform while being simpler to construct. However, the lack of free gun movement greatly limits its capabilities.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Use this if you plan to deploy cheaper tanks alongside defensive infantry§!"
 tank_oscillating_turret: "Oscillating Turret"
 tank_oscillating_turret_desc: "An unusual design where the gun is fixed into the turret, and in order to aim the gun, the entire turret rotates on a trunnion. This gives the gun great stability and allows for fast and flexible aiming. Due to its design, the trunnion system leaves the turret ring exposed and weakly armoured.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Use this if you want to maximise the damage output of your tank and use it exclusively on the offensive§!"
 tank_unmanned_turret: "Unmanned Tank Turret"
 tank_unmanned_turret_desc: "An unmanned turret is operated remotely from inside the hull of the tank, giving more protection to the crew. With no need for room for the crew, the turret itself can be made smaller and more heavily armoured. However, visibility is reduced as the turret has to be operated based on video feeds from the outside.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is a balanced futuristic tank turret. Use this if you want to maximise the armour that your tank has, at the slight cost of offensive capabilities§!"

 tank_torsion_bar_suspension: "Torsion Bar Suspension"
 tank_torsion_bar_suspension_desc: "A standard suspension system for tanks. Rods connected to road wheels are connected to a horizontal bar. As the wheels move up and down, the bar twists, acting as a suspension spring.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is a standard safe and low-risk option§!"
 tank_pneumatic_suspension: "Hydropneumatic suspension"
 tank_pneumatic_suspension_desc: "In a hydropneumatic suspension, a combination of hydraulic fluid and nitrogen gas are used as dampening elements of the suspension. With this suspension, the tank rides much more smoothly. The drive height can be adjusted on the fly and the tank has the ability to self level. This allows smoother movement and more stable aiming. However, as a suspension system it is more difficult to manufacture and maintain than a classic torsion bar system.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Equipping your tank with a hydropneumatic suspension makes your tank better overall at the cost of reliability and production cost§!"

 tank_composite_armor_gen1: "Early Cold War Composite Armour"
 tank_composite_armor_gen1_desc: "The first composite armours were experimented on the American T95 heavy tank. Fused silica glass (quartz glass) plates were installed between steel plates, giving increased protection against penetration. While never used in production, it served as an inspiration for later developments.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Composite armour is the standard option for modern main battle tanks§!"

 reactive_armor_gen1: "1st Generation ERA"
 reactive_armor_gen1_desc: "Explosive reactive armour (ERA) composes of bricks made of explosives on a metal frame installed on the tank. As the brick is hit by a kinetic penetrator or a shaped charge, the brick explodes, countering the incoming projectile. The first experiments were done in the 60s to counter early shaped charges, but none made it to production.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) is an easy way to upgrade your tank's armour§!"
 reactive_armor_gen2: "2nd Generation ERA"
 reactive_armor_gen2_desc: "By increasing the size of the ERA bricks and adding more explosives and a thicker frame, the explosive force can be increased to counter even kinetic penetrators.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) is an easy way to upgrade your tank's armour§!"

 spaced_armor_gen1: "Early Spaced Armour"
 spaced_armor_gen1_desc: "Spaced armour is an armour system where there is an additional armour plate on top of the main armour with a gap in between.

 wet_ammo_storage: "Blow-Out Panels"
 wet_ammo_storage_desc: "In case of a catastrophic ammo explosion, it is good to design the tank with predetermined weak points in mind. This way the blast will be directed outside of the tank rather than into the crew compartment.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: Blow-out are a good way to improve the survivability of your tank§!"

 automatic_loading: "Autoloading System"
 automatic_loading_desc: "In an autoloading system commonly found on Soviet and Russian tanks, a mechanical lift automatically pulls a new round into the gun. Because of this, the rounds are often stored in a carousel under or near the gun. In a tank with an autoloader the crew has to share the compartment with live ammo. While an autoloader gives a much better rate of fire than manual loading, a penetrating hit will often cook-off the ammo and burn the tank and its crew to a crisp.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: An autoloader grants the ability of more sustained firepower on targets, but makes the vehicle more likely to be catastrophically lost when damaged§!"
 manual_loading: "Manual Loading"
 manual_loading_desc: "With a traditional manual loading system often seen in Western tanks, a human loader loads new shells into the gun by hand. While this gives a rate of fire of about half of an autoloading system, manual loading provides the possibility of storing ammunition separate from the crew chamber. This protects the crew and the tank from a possible ammunition cook-off on hit.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: This is the standard loading system for any tank and a safe and low-risk option§!"
 revolver_magazine: "Revolver Magazine"
 revolver_magazine_desc: "An odd design of French origin. In the early Cold War, France experimented with equipping tanks with preloaded ammunition magazines. These revolver-style magazines would be stored at the back of the turret and feed the gun as it was fired. This allowed for an incredibly high rate of fire for the duration of a few rounds. However, the system could only be loaded from outside the tank, making the job of the loader the worst on the battlefield. The system never gained mainstream popularity.\n\n§GDesigner Hint: A revolver style loader allows you to maximise the damage you do to your enemies. However, the complicated reloading system makes sustaining an offensive difficult§!"

 hardkill_system_gen1: "Early Hard-Kill System"

 hardkill_system_gen2: "Improved Hard-Kill System"
 hardkill_system_gen2_desc: "An improved hard-kill system will be able to stop even fast moving kinetic penetrators and tandem shaped charges.

 mbt_hull_2: "3rd+ Generation Tank Hull"
 mbt_hull_2_desc: "A modern era tank hull.
