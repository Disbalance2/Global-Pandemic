 azeev.15.t: "Era of Aliev"
 azeev.15.d: "Azerbaijan, struck by the loss in the Karabakh war, thanks to the efforts of the former Soviet party leader Heydar Aliyev, was able to withstand politically, having suffered territorial losses. Aliyev is trying to build a hereditary system, trying to maneuver between various internal and external factors. Flexible diplomacy between West and East can make an important contribution to Azerbaijan's future success. However, the discouraged people demand peace and democracy, not wanting more deaths, the nationalists demand total war with Armenia and Iran, and the pro-Russian forces demand that the status quo be maintained. Having significant oil resources, but, however, an undeveloped infrastructure and industry, Azerbaijan can become a regional power if it does not fall into economic and political chaos, set on fire from outside and from within."
 azeev.15.a: "Yeah..."

 azeev.13.t: "Azerbaijani Army"
 azeev.13.d: "The Azerbaijani army, which suffered an absolute collapse after the defeat in the Artsakh war, but sponsored by various international groups and countries, is starting its gradual recovery. Disloyal generals, nationalist ideologists and warlords are parasites of the Azerbaijani army. It's time to change all that."
 azeev.13.a: "Indeed."

 azeev.14.t: "Azerbaijani Economy"
 azeev.14.d: "The post-Soviet economy of Azerbaijan after the 90s is in the deepest decline. The former great oil and agricultural industry is barely breathing, allowing Azerbaijan to somehow exist. However, foreign investors and a significant number of Azerbaijani resources make it possible for Azerbaijan to become an economically developed country in the future."
 azeev.14.a: "Here comes the money!"
