 SMA_MILLENIUM_DAWN_DESC: "San Marino is an extremely small country and is in fact completely dependent on Italy. Being landlocked and without airports, it is highly dependent on tourists, as they make up a large part of the GDP. Is it worth to go on the account of Italy, remaining in fact its territory, or it is necessary to go our own way? All this at the moment is decided by two captains-regents, who are appointed by the Great General Council for a period of 6 months. There are 60 members of the Great General Council. But there is also the Arengo, the Assembly of Heads of Families, which was the supreme body in ancient times, has now almost completely lost its power, but has retained the right of petition. The Captains Regents receive numerous petitions submitted by citizens on the first Sunday after April 1 and after October 1. Petitions submitted must be considered within 6 months."
