 shia_resistance_02: "Shia Resistance - Low"
 shia_resistance_02_desc: "Some radicals amongst the Shia population have called for the toppling of our government, but their calls have largely fallen on deaf ears. This is due to the relative lack of mistreatment by our government towards the Shia population."
 shia_resistance_03: "Shia Resistance - Moderate"
 shia_resistance_03_desc: "Anti-establishment Shia forces have gained some traction amongst the Shia population of our country due to some remaining barriers and difficulties faced by the Shia in our society. Opposition to violence, however, is still the most common position among the Shia."
 shia_resistance_04: "Shia Resistance - Substantial"
 shia_resistance_04_desc: "The unequal position of our Shia population relative to their Sunni counterparts has led to notable opposition to our government in certain quarters. While there is some militant activity against our government, this has so far remained relatively marginal."
 shia_resistance_05: "Shia Resistance - High"
 shia_resistance_05_desc: "Discrimination against the Shia has led to significant levels of openly-expressed resentment towards our government. Even more concerning is the increased support for militant Shia groups that advocate the removal of our government through violent means."
 shia_resistance_06: "Shia Resistance - Extremely High"
 shia_resistance_06_desc: "Our policies have substantially increased Shia hostility to our rule, increasing support for Shia militant groups that advocate the use of force against our government.

 shia_resistance_07_desc: "Our attitude towards the Shia has inflamed anti-government perceptions among the vast majority of the Shia population.

 shia_resistance_08_desc: "Our anti-Shia policies have led to overwhelming Shia opposition to our rule. While not all of this opposition has translated into open support for armed militant groups, most of the Shia population tacitly accept the use of violent tactics, emboldening Shia militant groups that have begun to launch more daring attacks."
 shia_resistance_09: "Shia Resistance - Critical"
 shia_resistance_09_desc: "Widespread hatred towards our government for its anti-Shia policies has led to widespread support for armed militancy among the Shia population. This support has emboldened Shia militant groups and allowed them to launch major attacks."

 birthplace_of_wahhabism_desc: "The nation of Saudi Arabia was established as a result of an alliance between the military might of Ibn Saud and the radical religious vision of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. The movement that the latter founded, Wahhabism, sets itself apart from other Islamic doctrines in its ardent commitment to purifying Islam and returning the faith to its earliest and most authentic form. The form of Wahhabism espoused by Saudi Arabia emphasizes respect for religious authorities and government, unlike the more revolutionary and populist brands of salafism influenced by the thought of Sayyid Qutb which most jihadist groups have adopted."
 little_sparta: "Little Sparta"
 little_sparta_desc: "The UAE has historically punched above its weight on the international stage, sending its military forces to take part in multilateral military operations in farflung corners of the globe.

Although the historical accuracy of this narrative is disputed, it has played a powerful role in mobilizing support against the Sunni Khalifa dynasty, who are perceived as foreign occupiers of the Baharna homeland."

 legacy_of_the_gulf_war_desc: "On August 2nd 1990 Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded the State of Kuwait and occupied the country for a period of seven months. During that time a resistance movement mobilized against the Iraqi invaders, with all Kuwaitis regardless of sect or social class coming together to fight against the occupiers. This event, along with a long history of Kuwait standing against much larger adversaries and boasting a uniquely powerful parliament, has helped cement a Kuwaiti national identity that, unlike in some of Kuwait's fellow Gulf states, has allowed Sunni and Shia to co-exist relatively seamlessly."

 israeli_settlements: "Israeli Settlements"
 israeli_settlements_desc: "Shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Day War of 1967 that saw Israel seize control of the West Bank from Jordan, a group of Zionist activists staying in a hotel in Hebron refused to leave. The Israeli government sought to compromise with the activists by establishing the first Jewish settlement in the West Bank, in doing so preventing Palestinian herders from continuing to use that land. That event began a trend that has continued to this day, with over a hundred settlements being established, to the growing chagrin of the Palestinian population."
 israeli_blockade: "Israeli Blockade"
 israeli_blockade_desc: "Since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah in 2007, Egypt and Israel have enforced a land, air and sea blockade of Gaza. While Israel has maintained that the blockade is legal under international law and that it is necessary to guarantee Israeli security and put pressure on a violent terrorist organization, humanitarian and intergovernmental organizations have accused Israel of inflicting collective punishment on the people of Gaza through the blockade, forcing the territory's inhabitants to remain dependent on humanitarian aid."
 palestinian_resistance: "Palestinian Resistance"
 palestinian_resistance_desc: "Ever since Zionist settlers first arrived in Palestine in the late 1800s, tensions between Jewish immigrants and the Palestinian population have often led to outbreaks of violence between the two communities. After the creation of Israel, Palestinian groups and even individuals have launched attacks against Israeli interests, a phenomenon that has persisted despite the signing of the Oslo Accords. This has been due to widespread Palestinian dissatisfaction about the continuing construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Israel's refusal to share control of Jerusalem among other grievances. These attacks have contributed to a sense of Israeli insecurity and support for hardline political forces."
 large_refugee_population: "Large Refugee Population"
 large_refugee_population_desc: "The 1948 Arab-Israeli War resulted in what Palestinians call al-Nakba, the catastrophe. This event saw a mass exodus of the Palestinian population from Israeli-controlled territory, leading to the establishment of large refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. These refugees live a precarious existence, as many governments have not granted citizenship to Palestinian refugees, thereby often denying them of the right to work and access public services. These refugees yearn to return to the homes that their families owned prior to 1948, producing a difficult issue to resolve given the fact that much of the land formerly owned by these refugees is now inhabited by Israelis."

 SAU_crown_prince_mbs: "Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman"
 SAU_crown_prince_mbs_desc: "Mohammed bin Salman, the ambitious and young son of King Salman, is viewed as a social reformer but also a political hawk. His fixation on countering the Iranian threat has led him to pursue an aggressive and rash foreign policy, while his consolidation of power has led him to antagonize powerful figures within the royal family and the Wahhabi ulema. His disregard for human rights has made him unpopular in the West, where he has few strong allies. Instead, he retains close links to other Arab autocrats, especially the Emirati Crown Prince."

The severity of terror attacks and the likelihood of them succeeding can be decreased by raising internal security spending and conducting counter-terrorism training.\n\nThe ability of a country to decrease its §YTerror Threat§! beyond a certain point depends on whether it is at war, its stability, GDP/c and level of corruption. §YTerror Threat§! can increase due to the level of §YRadicalization§! and infiltration by jihadists from neighboring countries.

However, the clumsy insertion of our operators alerted the terrorists, who promptly ambushed the attacking force, killing several operators before fleeing. Even worse, the terrorists detonated a bomb to cover their escape, killing multiple civilians who were caught up in the blast radius.

Moreover, multiple civilians were killed and wounded in the crossfire during the protracted gunfight. Experts have criticized the standard of our security services, as despite receiving some counter-terrorism training, our most elite operators cannot meet the same standards as their counterparts in other countries.

Equipped with small arms, rocket-propelled grenades and even some armored vehicles, the militants managed to inflict heavy damage to the base before retreating. The high casualty rate has been attributed to the poor performance of [FROM.GetAdjective] troops who failed to warn the military base of the incoming threat and did not take action despite requests for assistance. [FROM.GetAdjective] forces reportedly undergo a relatively low standard of counter-terrorism training, which many consider to be the main explanation for their ineffectiveness."

Equipped with small arms, rocket-propelled grenades and even some armored vehicles, the militants managed to inflict moderate damage to the base before retreating. Most of the casualties were inflicted at the initial stage of the attack, as the arrival of [FROM.GetAdjective] reinforcements forced the jihadists to flee before they could cause more damage. [FROM.GetAdjective] security forces have demonstrated a degree of effectiveness in combating terrorism but remain below the standards of elite international counter-terror units."

However, a combination of poor weather conditions and lack of expertise led to the mistaken targeting of a [ROOT.GetAdjective] village, resulting in the killing and wounding of dozens of civilians. Experts have criticized the standard of our pilots, as despite receiving some counter-terrorism training, our most highly trained pilots cannot meet the same standards as their counterparts in other countries.

 gulf.15.d: "Amid a notable increase in Turkish activity in the Middle East, the leader of [FROM.GetNameDef] has lambasted Turkish \"meddling\" and \"interference\" in the affairs of Arab states. [FROM.GetLeader] accused Turkey of seeing to \"revive the Ottoman Empire\" through its actions, drawing a hostile response from [TUR.GetLeader].

Critics have raised concerns about the coalition's lack of a Security Council resolution to justify its actions, making the operation illegal under international law. Russia and China, among others, have supported [SYR.GetLeader] in condemning the operation as a violation of Syrian sovereignty.

However, it may be in our interests to first inform the Americans of our operation and invite them to participate in the destruction of our shared enemy.

These refugees yearn to return to the homes that their families owned prior to 1948, producing a difficult issue to resolve given the fact that much of the land formerly owned by these refugees is now inhabited by Israelis.\n\nShould we choose to uphold the Palestinian right of return, Israel will be forced to accept the return of potentially millions of refugees into Israeli-administered territory.

[FROM.GetLeader] has responded to these statements urging caution by acknowledging the fact that peace has yet to be achieved but has sought to emphasize the unprecedented nature of the level of commitment to peace exhibited by both Israel and Palestine."

 uae_royal.1.d1: "The United Arab Emirates, along with a sizable proportion of the Muslim world, is in mourning today as the ailing president of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, has passed away. Sheikh Zayed is venerated in the UAE as the nation's founding father due to his role in uniting the once divided emirates. The Sheikh is also credited with cementing the UAE's alliances with Saudi Arabia and the West, committing the country to the War on Terror and increasing the Emirati role in UN peacekeeping operations. Sheikh Zayed is succeeded as President of the UAE and Emir of Abu Dhabi by his son, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan."

Sheikh Zayed is venerated in the UAE as the nation's founding father due to his role in uniting the once divided emirates. The last few years of his rule have seen the former absolute monarchy transform into a constitutional one where power is vested in elected leaders.

Despite being in a stable condition, the Sheikh is reportedly no longer capable of carrying out the day-to-day affairs of government. The Sheikh's half-brother and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has reportedly assumed de facto control of the Emirati state.\n\nMohammed bin Zayed, dubbed MbZ by Western analysts, is a relatively young leader but a nonetheless experienced one.

 oman_royal.1.t: "The Death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said"
 oman_royal.1.d: "The esteemed Sultan, ruler of Oman since 1970, has regrettably passed away. Sultan Qaboos is widely credited with the modernization of Oman, bringing about unprecedented development, an improvement in living standards, the abolition of slavery and end to a leftist rebellion in the western province of Dhofar. Internationally, he is remembered as the architect of an immensely successful neutral foreign policy that allowed Oman to build close ties to Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States, United Kingdom and even Israel.\n\nAs the Sultan had no children or siblings and did not publicly name an heir, the Omani royal family must collectively decide on his successor. The three most popular candidates for the position of Sultan are the children of Qaboos's uncle, Sayyid Tariq bin Taimur Al Said. Assad bin Tariq is a widely respected former military commander who has good relations with the leaders of the other Gulf states. Shihab bin Tariq is a former naval commander who maintains a low profile but has reportedly not been afraid to disagree with Sultan Qaboos on matters of policy in the past. Haitham bin Tariq is the preferred choice of Oman's merchants but lacks political experience."

King Fahd has been hailed by Arab and Western leaders alike as a visionary leader. His rule saw Saudi Arabia grow closer to the United States in an effort to undermine al-Qaeda, a group which has quickly become the most significant domestic threat to the Saudi monarchy. Crown Prince Abdullah, who has been de facto ruler since King Fahd's stroke, has now been crowned King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, and has pledged to continue his half-brother's modernization efforts."

 saudi_royal.2.d1: "Saudi Arabia, along with a sizable proportion of the Muslim world, is in mourning today as the ailing King Abdullah finally succumbed to years of poor health and passed away. King Abdullah's rule was a tumultous period of Saudi history, as the Kingdom struggled to respond to the uprisings that swept across the Middle East. Despite promises of reform, power in Saudi Arabia has overwhelmingly remained in the hands of the royal family and there is little indication that this will change in the near future.

 saudi_royal.3.d: "King Salman's son Mohammed has been a rising star within Saudi politics since his father came to power. During that time he has sought to consolidate his power by pursuing socioeconomic reform and sidelining political rivals. Now the young prince, known by Western analysts as MbS, has his sights on the throne via the position of crown prince. King Salman, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, must decide whether to satisfy his son's ambition and appoint him as crown prince, or to retain Mohammed bin Nayef, an experienced former interior minister feared and hated by Saudi jihadists."

 saudi_royal.4.d: "In an unprecedented move, King Salman has changed the line of succession to favour his ambitious son, Mohammed bin Salman. The young prince replaces the 57 year old Mohammed bin Nayef who previously held that position, a figure who earned respect both at home and abroad for his efforts to combat jihadist terror. Mohammed bin Salman has made waves in the kingdom by initiating a series of socioeconomic reforms and consolidating political power, in doing so antagonizing a range of pro-status quo figures. The prince was also instrumental in launching Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen."

It would be advisable for us to take action to reduce this pressure and salvage the kingdom's intenational reputation."

In the days following the incident it quickly became clear that the agents who murdered Khashoggi had close links to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of the Saudi king.\n\nIn response to mounting pressure on Saudi Arabia to bring those responsible to justice, King Salman has vocally condemned Prince Mohammed and stripped him of his status as crown prince and next in line to the throne. The Saudi King assured the international community that the political career of the former rising star has come to an end, and that he will soon face Saudi courts as an ordinary citizen. World leaders and human rights organizations have welcomed the announcement, but many have also vowed watch carefully to ensure justice has truly been served."

Several world leaders and human rights organizations have criticized the move, describing it as an attempt to absolve Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government of responsibility. In response to the lack of Saudi transparency, Germany and several other European nations have suspended all arms sales to the kingdom."

His unprecedented consolidation of power, marginalization of rivals and aggressive foreign policy have led some prominent princes to not so discreetly discuss the possibility of returning Mohammed bin Nayef to his original position. The crown prince wishes to arrest these dissenters and charge them with plotting a coup against the monarchy, thereby consolidating his own position even further.

 saudi_royal.8.t: "Saudi King Dismisses Son in Surprise Move"
 saudi_royal.8.d: "Many have noted the controversial rise of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who, as crown prince, has pursued an aggressive approach to both domestic and international politics. His role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi provoked widespread condemnation by civil society and some governments, and his reputation has been eroded by the lack of success of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. Now his controversial acts have led to his downfall, as King Salman has reinstated Mohammed bin Nayef, Mohammed bin Salman's predecessor and rival, as crown prince and consigned his own son to political oblivion. The move has been attributed to pressure from within the royal family from figures such as Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, the young brother of King Salman and the only surviving member of the powerful so-called Sudairi Seven apart from the king himself. The young prince is rumored to have been placed under house arrest awaiting the decision of Prince Ahmed, Mohammed bin Nayef and their allies as to his final fate."

 saudi_royal.9.d: "Several government officials and senior members of the royal family have been detained in a sweeping crackdown that is being seen as the latest attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate control over the country. Prominent figures that have been arrested include Mohammed bin Nayef, the widely respected former interior minister and predecessor of Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince, and Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, the King's younger brother.\n\nThe arrested princes have been accused of plotting to overthrow Mohammed bin Salman, who has alienated many within the royal family through his aggressive foreign policy and sidelining of rival royals. Some see this move as paving the way for the crown prince to take the throne, as the crackdown has helped eliminate two significant rivals who would have a powerful claim were the ailing King Salman to succumb to his poor health."

 saudi_royal.10.d: "In what is being described as a \"peaceful coup\", King Salman has shocked observers by announcing his abdication and the transferal of power to his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The young prince has spent years consolidating power within the royal family and recently managed to eliminate two of his most powerful rivals in a crackdown on alleged coup-plotters. Now, with the King Salman's poor health as the pretext, he has managed to secure the throne and will soon be crowned King Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques."

Many have taken up the slogans of the [FROM.GetAdjective] revolution, calling upon their leaders to enact meaningful reform or, in some cases, resign en masse. Arab leaders have begun scrambling to either accommodate or suppress protests, hoping to avoid the fate of the [FROM.GetAdjective] dictator.\n\nThe rapid spread of pro-democracy movements throughout the region, which some have started referring to as the \"Arab Spring\", has taken the world by surprise. However many experts in past years have highlighted the fragility of Arab regimes which have relied on coercion and surveillance to maintain their rule. All across the region, alienation from a distant ruling elite, rampant corruption, and economic woes have slowly fed a widespread desire for change in some shape or form. It is these sentiments that have now exploded into a region-wide popular movement calling for change."

The clearing operations have seen outbreaks of violence between loyalist troops and armed protesters, who have acquired firearms from police armories and military defectors.\n\nIt is quickly becoming clear that what was once a non-violent protest movement is quickly descending first into insurgency, and then into civil war. In some parts of the country, it appears that opposition fighters have taken control of entire cities, but much of the information coming out of [FROM.GetNameDef] has become confused and convoluted. World leaders have called for restraint, while human rights organizations have criticized the brutality of [FROM.GetLeader]'s repression of protests."

 arab_spring.15.d: "[ISI.GetLeader] today declared the formation of what he described as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. He revealed that the al-Nusra group fighting the regime in Syria had been formed by members of the Islamic State in Iraq, and that the two organizations were now merging. Al-Nusra and its al-Qaeda backers have however disavowed ISIL, calling for it to be abolished.\n\nAnalysts are of the opinion that al-Qaeda and its Syrian branch, al-Nusra, have very different goals and methods from ISIL, while sharing a common ideology and opposition to the Syrian government. [ISI.GetLeader]'s organization has always sought to act independently of al-Qaeda, pursuing its own sectarian agenda that targets Muslim minority groups in a way that al-Qaeda has not done to the same extent. While its aspirations are transnational, al-Qaeda branches such as al-Nusra have normally confined their activities to target individual governments."

 arab_spring.18.d: "Although some radicals continue to demonstrate against our government, the majority of protesters have returned to their homes following a sharp decline in the protest movement's momentum. However, our informants tell us that anti-government sentiments still remain in much of the country. It appears that the protest movement has lost support due to fatigue and frustration rather than as a result of greater support for our government. Nonetheless, the immediate danger to our government has been successfully averted."
 arab_spring.18.d1: "Following efforts by our government to address the demands of the protesters, the pro-democracy movement in our country has lost momentum. The vast majority of the former protesters appear to be satisfied by our measures, and are not demanding further reform."
