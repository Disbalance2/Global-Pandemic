The theory states that the Communist Party must be representative of advanced social productive forces, advanced culture, and the interests of the majority.

Zeng Qinghong thought calls for a more accountable and transparent party that can be perceived as more representative and legitimate by the Chinese people. Key to this theory is the idea of the “gaze of the people” and how party officials can only maximize the interests of the country when working under this gaze."

The ROC has sought to retain the loyalty of the few states that continue to recognize it, but it is fighting a losing battle.

However China's great power aspirations have undermined Russia's position, as the Slavic giant has been forced out of its Central Asian sphere of influence by Chinese money.

Among other things, the document outlines the status of Hong Kong relative to China, granted it autonomy in all matters other than defence and foreign affairs, both of which are entrusted to the central government."
 One_Country_Two_Systems: "One Country Two Systems"
 One_Country_Two_Systems_desc: "Hong Kong and Macau has been guaranteed 50 years of autonomy from direct Chinese rule. The model of one country two systems allows for a preservation and indeed growth of many of Hong Kong and Macau's treasured political freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of public assembly. The absence of these rights in the mainland is a significant driver behind support for the \"pan-democrat\" camp in Hong Kong politics, with many concerned Hongkongers remaining wary of greater integration with mainland China."

In the following decades powerful triads such as the Wo Shing Wo, Sun Yee On and 14K triads have run protection rackets, gambling dens and other illicit activities. Despite their anti-communist roots, the triads have also started supporting Chinese interests in Hong Kong due to business connections on the mainland."
 Localist_Movement: "Localist Movement"
 Localist_Movement_desc: "Ever since the handover in 1997, tensions between mainland Chinese and Hongkongers have led to the development of localist \"Hong Kong First\" sentiment amongst some local Hongkongers. This sentiment views communist China's political system with distrust, but also views Hong Kong people as culturally distinct and indeed superior compared to the people of China. The rise of this movement from the 2014 Umbrella Movement onward has changed the previously more measured tone of the Hong Kong political divide into one that is more emotive and radical."
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage: "Lacks Universal Suffrage"
 Lacks_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "While the Basic Law calls for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council to eventually be elected by universal suffrage, this eventuality has yet to come to pass primarily due to China's concerns about what may happen if the significantly more popular pan-democrats take control of the government."

 Limited_Universal_Suffrage_desc: "China has agreed to allow the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to be elected by universal suffrage, on the condition that candidates must be vetted by China first.

 #International Recognition
 Non_State_Actor: "Non-State Actor"
 Non_State_Actor_desc: "Many international actors, from rebel groups to NGOs, possess international significance but are severly disadvantaged in a number of different ways by virtue of not being recognized states. Some of these non-state actors aspire to take control of an existing state by overthrowing an unjust government or to fashion a new one and redraw international borders. Others have no ambition for statehood, but instead use blunt force to accumulate power and wealth in local environments where the authority of the central government is absent."
 Lacks_International_Recognition: "Aspiring State"
 Lacks_International_Recognition_desc: "Some states possess everything you would normally associate with a state. A bureaucracy, a military, a national flag and so on. However, their statehood will never be complete without the added benefits conferred by the stamp of legitimacy of international recognition. These states may seek to acquire this recognition by campaigning for their cause overseas, with the eventual aim of winning the support of a critical mass of states in order to become full members of the international community."

 rival_government_desc: "Civil wars over control of the entire nation tend to produce two or more governments that claim to be the legitimate representatives of their people. This government is one that makes such a claim, but is disadvantaged by the fact that its status as legitimate representative is only recognized by a few other states, if any. It therefore does not represent its nation at international forums like the United Nations."

Citizens can change the constitution per referendum, can veto laws per referendum, can even pass laws per referendum.\nThis has implications for politicians however: Because the people make the policies either way, the Swiss coalition system has to include as many forces as possible.

Thus, its neutrality is considered less total than the one of its Swiss neighbors."
 belgian_political_system: "Political System of Belgium"

Sometimes a bit too thoroughly maybe."
