The Japanese diet met on April 5th, 2000, to find a replacement for the Prime Minister.\nKeizō Obuchi would never recover again, eventually dying in the hospital on May 14th. He leaves behind one son and two daughters, one of them, Yūko, also a politician of the Liberal Democrats."
 japan_classic.16.o1: "Yoshirō Mori needs to lead."
 japan_classic.17.t: "Naka-Meguro Derailment"
 japan_classic.17.d: "On March 8th, 2000, around 9 AM Japanese time, a TRTA Hibiya Line train was sideswiped by another train, killing 5 and injuring 63 after the rearmost car of the train had derailed in a tight curve, crashing into a bypassing vehicle."
 japan_classic.17.o1: "We will send all help needed."
 japan_classic.17.o2: "The situation will rectify itself."
 japan_classic.18.t: "Yoshirō Mori's political gaffe"
 japan_classic.18.d: "On May 15th, 2000, newly elected Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori got into major negative headlines for the first time when he publicly referred to Japan as \"a Divine Nation centered on the Emperor\". This, in the eyes of both the opposition and the ruling LDP, calls the democratic ideals of Japan as well as the role of the monarchy into question.\nPublic approval ratings of the Prime Minister have dropped."
 japan_classic.18.o1: "What a fool!"
 japan_classic.18.o2: "Double down on his statements."
 japan_classic.19.t: "Fusako Shigenobu arrested"
 japan_classic.19.d: "The leader of the Japanese Red Army, Fusako Shigenobu, was arrested in Osaka on November 8th, 2000.\nThe Japanese Red Army was a militant communist militia aiming to destroy the monarchy, topple the Japanese government and start a world revolution.\nFollowing the arrests, the Japanese Red Army would soon be disbanded in early 2001."
 japan_classic.19.o1: "The communist rebels are losing ground."
 japan_classic.19.o2: "Set her free, she is right."
 japan_classic.20.t: "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster"
 japan_classic.20.d: "On March 11th, 2011, Japan was hit by the devastating Tōhoku earthquake, followed by a tsunami, primarily hitting the north-eastern coast of the island of Honshū.\n\nMany Japanese citizens were displaced and had to leave their homes, but this is not out of the ordinary for a country living on the Pacific Fire Ring. However, the damage done to Fukushima Daiichi, one of Japan's most vital nuclear reactors, is not only out of the ordinary, but absolutely catastrophic.\nIn a nuclear disaster that only Chernobyl 1986 could measure up to, the tsunami destroyed the emergency reactors that were to cool the reactors after the automatic shutdown. The Units 1, 2 and 3 suffered nuclear meltdowns, being accompanied by hydrogen-air chemical explosions and massive release of radioactive material.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the reactor was strong enough to sentence an unprotected human to death after a mere minute; the regional area thus became uninhabitable.\n\nThe catastrophe changed public opinion on nuclear power the world over."
 japan_classic.20.o1: "A black day for our nation."

 japan_classic.70.t: "Japan seeks Chinese Alliance"
 japan_classic.70.d: "The Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has recently announced that Japan would seek a new possible alliance with its former rival and constant adversary China.\nThe Chinese have yet to respond - but whatever Beijing's decision might be, the political climate of East Asia is changing."
 japan_classic.70.o1: "A new age!"
 japan_classic.70.o2: "Let us hope for the best."
 japan_classic.70.o3: "We shall consider our choices."
 japan_classic.70.o4: "The Chinese will make a good choice."
 japan_classic.70.o5: "How odd."
 japan_classic.70.o6: "We will destroy them anyway."
 japan_classic.71.t: "Japan embraces the Path of War!"
 japan_classic.71.d: "\"The grand Japanese heritage cannot be put into question by our past experiences and our most shameful defeat in 1945. We need to put our country and our national pride back on its feet and look forward, united, strengthened and ready to strike. We will not avoid conflict just to preserve peace. Not anymore!\"\n\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] held quite the sensational speech in Tokyo. Japan seems to have renewed ambitions for superpower status."
 japan_classic.71.o1: "We are unstoppable!"
 japan_classic.71.o2: "Hail Japan!"
 japan_classic.71.o3: "Very worrying."
 japan_classic.71.o4: "They need to be stopped."
 japan_classic.71.o5: "Do they want to get nuked AGAIN?"
 japan_classic.72.t: "Japan seeks Trade with China"
 japan_classic.72.d: "Denying American advances into the Japanese economy, the Tokyo government has announced that they would instead seek closer trade relationships with the Chinese, rather than 'selling the Japanese people to the Americans', according to the Japanese Minister of Finance."
 japan_classic.72.o1: "A good choice!"
 japan_classic.72.o2: "Intriguing."
 japan_classic.72.o3: "That comes close to betrayal."
 japan_classic.72.o4: "An interesting development."
 japan_classic.73.t: "Japan adapts Article 9"
 japan_classic.73.d: "Article 9 of the Japanese constitution states: \"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\"\nThis has been interpreted to not only outlaw war, but also military action abroad. The Japanese government is now getting rid of the latter clause - putting fear in the opposition that the former might be next."
 japan_classic.73.o1: "It had to be done."
 japan_classic.73.o2: "Japan is remilitarizing."
 japan_classic.74.t: "Japan abandons Defensive Principles"
 japan_classic.74.d: "With the world growing more and more tense, the Japanese government has today declared that it would be ready to defend Japanese interests and its ideological persistence both at home and, importantly, abroad.\n\nThis is a major uproar in Japanese foreign policy."
 japan_classic.74.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.74.o2: "We stand by our ally."
 japan_classic.74.o3: "How worrying."
 japan_classic.74.o4: "Death to Japan!"
 japan_classic.75.t: "Japan declares Interventionism"
 japan_classic.75.d: "Japan has reassured the global community that it would stand strong in its democratic values, but that it would also pursue a more aggressive foreign policy to enforce democratic principles both at home and abroad."
 japan_classic.75.o1: "Freedom we bring and fascists we slay."
 japan_classic.75.o2: "Good choice."
 japan_classic.75.o3: "Defending democracy is a good thing at least."
 japan_classic.75.o4: "Another one of those 'democrats'. Ugh."
 japan_classic.75.o5: "We will destroy these Japs!"
 japan_classic.76.t: "Japan abolishes the Monarchy"
 japan_classic.76.d: "In a move that draws closer and closer to communistic ideology, the Japanese government has today dismantled the Chrysanthemum Throne, the position of the Japanese Emperor. The first emperor, as according to legend, sat on the throne around 650 BC; and the first confirmed emperor did so in 100 BC. Either way, the Japanese monarchy was the longest-existing monarchy in the world."
 japan_classic.76.o1: "Good riddance."
 japan_classic.76.o2: "Everything has to come to an end."
 japan_classic.77.t: "Japan empowers the Emperor"
 japan_classic.77.d: "\"Japan, in these troubled times, requires a strong and unifying leader, something that I cannot offer.\"\nThe Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has today angered the opposition of his country and many countries across the world by giving a speech about a possible restoration of Absolute Monarchy in Japan. [JAP.GetLeader] has presented several reforms (that are expected to pass) to the National Diet in order to make the transition happen."
 japan_classic.77.o1: "Long live the Empire!"
 japan_classic.77.o2: "The Japanese are doing the right thing."
 japan_classic.77.o3: "So much for values."
 japan_classic.78.t: "Japan seeks to spread the Revolution"
 japan_classic.78.d: "\"The people of Korea are in desperate need of liberation and their workers shall be freed.\", the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Japan has declared in Tokyo.\nThis is a complete novelty in foreign policy and could mean a war in East Asia."
 japan_classic.78.o1: "Glory to Japan!"
 japan_classic.78.o2: "This is outrageous!"
 japan_classic.78.o3: "The Red Revolution is spreading!"
 japan_classic.78.o4: "We need to fight communism!"
 japan_classic.78.o5: "Totalitarianism is spreading."
 japan_classic.79.t: "Japan declares Racial Supremacy"
 japan_classic.79.d: "\"And thus, with scientific and cultural evidence, we have definitive proof that the Japanese people are the chosen race.\"\nEven if the Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] did not present the evidence he spoke of, the implications of a Japanese return to fascism through a declaration of 'racial supremacy' are very severe. Japanese foreign aggression has become very real."
 japan_classic.79.o1: "Hail us!"
 japan_classic.79.o2: "They are going crazy."
 japan_classic.80.t: "[Root.GetName] declares Mass Mobilization"
 japan_classic.80.d: "\"In the name of the safety of our people, our nation and our friends, we need every available recruit. The cynical opposition and our enemies will call this 'mass mobilization', we should rather refer to it as 'national awakening' however. This has nothing to do with foreign aggression.\"\nIn an act of foreign aggression, [Root.GetLeader], head of the [Root.GetAdjective] government, has declared a state of mass mobilization in the country."
 japan_classic.80.o1: "For the fatherland!"
 japan_classic.80.o2: "We still have their backs."
 japan_classic.80.o3: "Let's hope they don't become a threat."
 japan_classic.80.o4: "The [Root.GetAdjective] threat is growing."
 japan_classic.80.o5: "We will enjoy killing these recruits."
 japan_classic.81.t: "The Korean Unification Ultimatum"
 japan_classic.81.d: "In an originally Japanese proposal, the Tokyo and Seoul governments have issued a joint statement called \"Joint Japanese-Korean Demand for Democracy for the Korean People\", in which the two countries threaten North Korea with war in order to unify the Korean Peninsula under Seoul leadership.\nA response is expected not only from Pyongyang, but also from Beijing."
 japan_classic.81.o1: "Let's go!"
 japan_classic.81.o2: "How dare they?!"
 japan_classic.81.o3: "We will stand by our allies."
 japan_classic.81.o4: "Pyongyang is justified."
 japan_classic.81.o5: "What is even happening?"
 japan_classic.82.t: "China beats Japan into submission!"
 japan_classic.82.d: "Japan has dropped its demands to the North Korean after the Chinese government called out partial mobilization of its forces and began moving towards the North Korean border, ready to cross it like they did in the 1950s to once again save Pyongyang from utter destruction.\nJapanese diplomatic reputation is tarnished and South Korea has made a fool of itself."
 japan_classic.82.o1: "Shameful display!"
 japan_classic.82.o2: "Victory is our destiny!"
 japan_classic.82.o3: "It is peace in our time."
 japan_classic.83.t: "China refuses to aid North Korea!"
 japan_classic.83.d: "\"The Chinese government has no further interest in propping up the failed North Korean state. Our protection for them is null and void.\"\nIn an unprecedented and unexpected move, the Chinese government has abandoned North Korea to its fate in the face of approaching Japanese and South Korean troops."
 japan_classic.83.o1: "And what a good choice that is."
 japan_classic.83.o2: "It had to be done."
 japan_classic.83.o3: "TRAITORS! TRAITORS!"
 japan_classic.83.o4: "North Korea stands no chance."
 japan_classic.84.t: "North Korean officials flee the country!"
 japan_classic.84.d: "In the middle of the night, North Korean government officials have fled the country in the face of growing civil resentment and the impending Japanese and South Korean invasion. Several trains left the country for Russia and China, with a government-in-exile possibly in the process of being formed."
 japan_classic.84.o1: "That means victory!"
 japan_classic.84.o2: "Well, they can have refuge for now."
 japan_classic.84.o3: "Farewell, world."
 japan_classic.84.o4: "North Korea is no more."
 japan_classic.85.t: "The North unites Korea!"
 japan_classic.85.d: "\"This is the greatest victory of our time. The once oppressed people of the south are now free to live and enjoy life together with their northern brethren, as the almighty eternal ruler intended.\"\nNorth Korean Leader [NKO.GetLeader] held a speech in Seoul, the former capital of South Korea, today. South Korea has failed in the eternal struggle of these two different versions of a Korean nation state. The entire country is now ruled from Pyongyang."
 japan_classic.85.o1: "Glorious!"
 japan_classic.85.o2: "The dawn of a new era."
 japan_classic.86.t: "The South unites Korea!"
 japan_classic.86.d: "\"And thus, we bring the people of North Korea our freedoms and our rights and our virtues, as they are finally free from their oppressors and their slave holders, finally free from slavery and totalitarian rule.\"\nSouth Korean President [KOR.GetLeader] held a speech in Pyongyang, the former capital city of North Korea, today. In the seemingly eternal struggle of the two Koreas against each other, North Korea finally collapsed and gave way to a stronger South Korea, now simply called Korea. The Seoul government has united the Korean people under an independent, united and sovereign government for the first time since the Japanese invaded the Empire of Korea in 1910."
 japan_classic.86.o1: "Unity at last!"
 japan_classic.86.o2: "A new age has begun."
 japan_classic.87.t: "China reunites with Taiwan!"
 japan_classic.87.d: "China has annexed the former 'Republic of China', also known as Taiwan, which had been exiled to the island of the same name since 1950."
 japan_classic.87.o1: "Finally."
 japan_classic.87.o2: "Alright."
 japan_classic.88.t: "Taiwan reconquers China!"
 japan_classic.88.d: "Taiwan has restored its dominance over the territories of the former People's Republic of China. This means that the Republic of China is truly China once more."
 japan_classic.88.o1: "Glorious!"
 japan_classic.88.o2: "Incredible!"
 japan_classic.89.t: "The Fukushima disaster"
 japan_classic.89.d: "North-eastern Honshū was hit by the Tōhoku earthquake on March 11th, 2011.\nThis earthquake and the subsequent tsunami severely damaged the nuclear power reactor Fukushima Daiichi, which suffered a faulty emergency shutdown and then went on to losing three of its four main units to nuclear meltdowns. This is possibly the greatest nuclear disaster in history, only matched by the 1986 Chernobyl incident."

 Japan.8.t: "China is Demanding the Senkaku Islands!"
 Japan.8.d: "China has revived their dispute with us over ownership of the Senkaku islands. If we give in to their demands we might increase China's confidence in its ability to influence our foreign policy as well as reduce our popularity among the more nationalistic of our people. However, the consequences of refusing probably do not bode well for us either."

 Japan.6.b: "We should call upon our protectors!"
 Japan.6.c: "This was probably an accident..."
 Japan.7.t: "Chinese and Japanese Fighter Jets Engage in Aerial Combat"
 Japan.7.d: "The East China Sea has erupted into conflict following a confrontation between Chinese and Japanese aircraft. The clash reportedly began when Japanese jets were scrambled to intercept Chinese fighters over Japanese airspace. Rather than resulting in a Chinese retreat which has historically occurred after similar incidents, Japanese aircraft were fired upon, resulting in the deaths of several Japanese pilots and the loss of multiple aircraft. [JAP.GetLeader] has strongly condemned the incident and is reportedly engaged in urgent talks behind closed doors regarding Japan's response to this event."

 JAP_deflation_desc: "Following the 1987 Tokyo Stock Market Crash and the burst of the 1992 Asset Price Bubble, Japan's economy has been in decline. With huge government bailouts to prop up key enterprises and banks, the response to the crisis built up one of the largest public debts in the world. The bad business environment in Japan leads Japanese corporations to invest very little inside of Japan, with profits instead put into abroad or government bonds to sustain the huge debt. Due to deflation, the rise in the value of the Yen, this gives stable profits for savers even with minuscule or negative interest rates, leaving no incentives to consume or invest in the real economy. This deflation allows Japan to sustain huge debts that would make any other country bankrupt. Unfortunately, it also ensures anemic economic growth with no solution in sight."
