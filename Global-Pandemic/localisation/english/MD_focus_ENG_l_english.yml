 United_Kingdom.1.t: "Falklands Policy"
 United_Kingdom.1.d: "The Falkland Islands have been a point of contention between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina for decades, with Argentina formally laying claim to the island archipelago (as well as neighboring South Georgia) in 1833.\n\nThe Falklands were first colonized by France in 1764 with a settlement on the eastern island, which was joined by a British settlement on the western one in 1766. However, the island group was granted to Spain the same year and the British colonists left eight years later. Spain formally stopped colonial investments in the island group in 1811 in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and the threat of independence movements - including the Argentinian one - in Latin America.\n\nThe Argentinians took the Falklands (calling them 'Islas Mavlinas' in Spanish) in 1820, establishing a settlement there. The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands. The British government responded (much to the surprise of Argentina) with military action. The subsequent Falkland War ended on June 20th with total British victory and a return to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe Argentinians were not deterred and still claim the islands even after the end of their junta. There is really no reason why they should be Argentinian, but having a country that owes Britain a favor could be good in the long run..."
 United_Kingdom.1.a: "Over our dead bodies, old chap! Now, where is my tea?"
 United_Kingdom.1.b: "We should turn over the islands to Argentina."
 United_Kingdom_News.1.t: "Britain cedes the Falkland Islands"
 United_Kingdom_News.1.d: "In an absolutely stunning surprise move, the government in London has decided to end the centuries-old conflict  between Britain and Argentina and to return the Falkland Islands, as well as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, to Argentina. The Argentinians had laid claim to the Falklands in 1833, to South Georgia in 1927 and the South Sandwich Islands in 1936.\n\nThe Argentinian government was overjoyed, promising a new age of Argentine-British relations."

 ##United Kingdom-Focus Tree##
 britain_md.1.t: "The Kingdom broken"
 britain_md.1.d: "Both Scotland and Wales have left our kingdom. The great English legacy once more is just that: English. There is growing resentment in the now independent Scottish and Welsh populations that we are still claiming them in name. We should formalize what is the truth: We are merely England once more."
 britain_md.1.o1: "Very well then."
 britain_md.1.o2: "Never! The sun never sets on the BRITISH Empire!"
 britain_md.2.t: "The Future of the NHS"
 britain_md.2.d: "The National Health Service is the public healthcare program of the United Kingdom and its future in government budgets is always hotly contested between the political parties. We should probably come to a decision what direction the government should take on this vital issue."
 britain_md.2.o1: "Expand the NHS"
 britain_md.2.o2: "Privatize the NHS"
 britain_md.3.t: "Britain demands Special Treatment"
 britain_md.3.d: "The British delegation to the European Parliament has been walking around Brussels like a bunch of puppeteers playing with their puppets recently. They are thwarting every move by the union and blocking most of our progress. This is becoming unbearable."
 britain_md.3.o1: "Are you serious?"
 britain_md.4.t: "The Brexit Referendum"
 britain_md.4.d: "\"Brexit\", short for British Exit, is the weird term given by the British and international press to the concept of Britain leaving the European Union.\n\nNow, this concept is to come to fruition: The British citizens are to vote on their future in the Union: Leave? Or Stay?"
 britain_md.4.o1: "Let the voting begin."
 britain_md.5.t: "The monarchy abolished!"
 britain_md.5.d: "Sensing the change in time, the British monarch has today undertaken steps to revoke their claims on the throne. In the meantime, government officials are making sure that the founding documents of our country are rewritten in a way as to no monarch being necessary to represent it.\nThis is the end of the British monarchy."
 britain_md.5.o1: "Good riddance."
 britain_md.6.t: "Queen Elizabeth II abdicates!"
 britain_md.6.d1: "\"I never asked for this. I never thought that Britain would return onto a dark path of unenlightened tyranny. I am too old, too frail and frankly unwilling to run a country. If Britain truly chooses to give powers back to the monarchy, they will have to find another candidate.\"\n\nIn a political shock, Queen Elizabeth II has abdicated. Even though the preparations for the coronations of her son Charles, soon to be Charles III of the United Kingdom, are being, the British people cannot stop themselves from looking at themselves and questioning if that path is truly the right one."
 britain_md.6.d2: "\"This is absolutely unacceptable. I myself have fought against Hitler's war machine in the British Armed Forces, and now the British government with the backing of the British people is returning to proto-fascistic tendencies. I will not and cannot stand for this.\"\n\nIn a political earthquake, Queen Elizabeth II abdicated in protest of the recent government choices. Her son, soon to be King Charles III, is preparing to be coronated."
 britain_md.6.o1: "Long live the King!"
 britain_md.7.t: "Britain supports NATO!"
 britain_md.7.d: "The British government has sent a military delegation to our ministry of defence. Their reaffirmed support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will only help us."
 britain_md.7.o1: "Thanks, old chap."
 britain_md.8.t: "British Trade Investments"
 britain_md.8.d: "A British Trade Delegation has arrived in our capital. This will only increase our economic ties to the United Kingdom."
 britain_md.8.o1: "That can't be bad, right?"
 britain_md.9.t: "National Development"
 britain_md.9.d: "A new National Development project has begun. There are several projects in the works right now and one of them certainly will come to fruition."
 britain_md.9.o1: "Let's see where this goes."
 britain_md.10.t: "Britain attacks Capitalism"
 britain_md.10.d: "The British government, in economic and diplomatic ties to us, has recently declared its intention to utterly destroy intercontinental capitalism. This will surely put a strain on our relations."
 britain_md.10.o1: "These fools."
 britain_md.10.o2: "Maybe their way is the right one?"
 britain_md.11.t: "The Britain-EU border agreement"
 britain_md.11.d: "The idea of a comprehensive revision of our current agreement with the Schengen zone has been tossed around in Parliament for quite some time. We have to choose our next step carefully."
 britain_md.11.o1: "Border Security first!"
 britain_md.11.o2: "A more open policy is the way."
 britain_md.12.t: "The CANZUK Alliance"
 britain_md.12.d: "Britain has recently approached us with the request to sever our so far military arrangement and go for an alliance inside the Anglosphere. This CANZUK project includes Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom."
 britain_md.12.o1: "Sounds like a fine proposal!"
 britain_md.12.o2: "We have our own problems."
 britain_md.13.t: "Britain requests workforce border deal"
 britain_md.13.d: "The British government has approached us over a possible border arrangement that allows Irish citizens to pass into Northern Ireland easier in order to improve both the local Irish standard of living the Northern Irish economy. This possible arrangement is popular with the Irish population - as it offers employment to the struggling economy."
 britain_md.13.o1: "Sounds fine."
 britain_md.13.o2: "We would rather not."
 britain_md.14.t: "Air Travel Agreement with Europe"
 britain_md.14.d: "We have finalized the outlines of a relatively free future air travel between the UK and the EU. Personal and goods transport by aircraft has been made more straightforward as a process. Both the European and British public are in favor of decreasing the unnecessary cost caused by the current arrangements."
 britain_md.14.o1: "Good."
 britain_md.15.t: "British Alliance invites us"
 britain_md.15.d: "The British government has requested that we join their alliance. This would mean abandoning our own, if applicable, and given up possible leadership claims."
 britain_md.15.o1: "Sure!"
 britain_md.15.o2: "Heck no."
 britain_md.16.t: "European Military Cooperation Program"
 britain_md.16.d: "The British government has launched the EMCP, the European Military Cooperation Program. The British armed forces have made defending their allies' territory a priority in order to defend their own."
 britain_md.16.o1: "We appreciate the help."
 britain_md.17.t: "Reorganize the Education System"
 britain_md.17.d: "With a far more national government course, we need to also restructure our future education program: Should we exclude pupils of ethnic minorities, catering to the fascists, or should we simply remove any quotas based on race and sex and emphasize merit?"
 britain_md.17.o1: "Based on merit."
 britain_md.17.o2: "Based on ethnic background."
 britain_md.17.o3: "A hybrid system sounds fine."
 britain_md.18.t: "Revolutionary Committee in Britain"
 britain_md.18.d: "The British government has revealed its newest government agency: A revolutionary committee, focusing on driving ahead the red workers' revolution into other countries. Our economic ties to Britain are bound to suffer."
 britain_md.18.o1: "Fools!"
 britain_md.19.t: "The Quebec Revolt"
 britain_md.19.d: "We have been in contact with the Franco Canadian population of Quebec. The support for independence is now overwhelming and a militant force is prepared to take up arms. At the same time, we have also sowed dissent among Canadian east coast populations.\n\nOur demands to Canada will be simple: Let Quebec be free and retreat from its Anglo Canadian Atlantic provinces."
 britain_md.19.o1: "Send the demands!"
 britain_md.20.t: "Britain attacks Canada!"
 britain_md.20.d: "\"We have two simple demands to the government of Canada:\n1: Immediately grant independence to the Canadian province of Quebec as an independent and sovereign nation, including the grand cities of Quebec City and Montreal.\n2: Cede the Canadian provinces New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador to the British government.\nShould the Canadian government resist, war is inevitable.\n\nsigned, the [ENG.GetAdjective] government\nsigned, the Quebecois government-in-exile in London\"\n\nWhat do we do now?!"
 britain_md.20.o1: "We will bow to their demands. This time."
 britain_md.20.o2: "No step back, buddies! No apologies!"
 britain_md.21.t: "British Defensive Assistance"
 britain_md.21.d: "As Britain draws ever closer to a greater European solution, they have once again reaffirmed their wish to stand by our side militarily."
 britain_md.21.o1: "Good."
 britain_md.22.t: "'Leave'!"
 britain_md.22.d: "The results are in, and with an edge of about 4%, the 'Leave' campaign won. Britain will have to prepare to leave the European Union."
 britain_md.22.o1: "Alright then."
 britain_md.23.t: "'Remain'!"
 britain_md.23.d: "The referendum is done and the results have been counted. At about 53% to 47%, the 'Remain' campaign won. 'Leave' campaigners Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson have already announced their willingness to accept the results - Britain stays!"
 britain_md.23.o1: "Indeed we do."
 britain_md.24.t: "Ireland accepts!"
 britain_md.24.d: "The Irish government has gladly accepted our proposal. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is opening up already."
 britain_md.24.o1: "Excellent!"
 britain_md.25.t: "Queen Elizabeth II dies"
 britain_md.25.d: "Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, daughter of George VI, has peacefully passed in her sleep. She was nearly 100 years old and had been queen for nearly 70.\n\nThe nation and the commonwealth at large are in mourning. The long reign of the queen oversaw the end of the Empire, the revitalization of the Home Islands, the entry into the European Union and a proud and strong start into the dawning 3rd millennium.\n\nThe queen was a living legend. But every legend eventually dies."
 britain_md.25.o1: "She will reign in heaven now."
 britain_md.26.t: "King Charles III dies"
 britain_md.26.d: "'Charles is dead', a newspaper titles, followed by the subheading 'Only few are mourning'.\n\nKing Charles III was historically unpopular, comparable to the likes of his grand uncle Edward VIII.\n\nHis son, William V, will surely be a more popular king for the British people."
 britain_md.26.o1: "No king rules forever."
