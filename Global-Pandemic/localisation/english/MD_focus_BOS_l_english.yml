 Bosnia: "Bosnian Focus Tree"
 BOSNIA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC: "Bosnia, a land rich in history and culture, has been molded by the hands of foreign empires, from the might of the Roman Empire to the collapse of the Federal Yugoslav Republic. Despite the scars left by its violent struggle for independence, the people of Bosnia remain steadfast in their journey towards a better future. \n \nThough the ethnic and religious divides linger, they do not diminish the hope and resilience of a nation determined to overcome its past. The future of Bosnia may be uncertain, but its people's unwavering spirit is a beacon of light, shining brightly towards a brighter tomorrow. "

 faction_map_bos_desc: "Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with a diverse population made up of several ethnic groups. The three main ethnic groups are Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs, and they have a long and complex history in the region.\n \nDuring the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence, leading to a brutal war that lasted from 1992 to 1995. That resulted in the displacement of over 2 million people.\n \nAfter the war ended, the Dayton Accords were signed, establishing a power-sharing government between the three main ethnic groups. Under this system, the country is divided into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is predominantly Bosniak and Croat, and the Republika Srpska, which is predominantly Serbian. The country also has a central government, with a presidency that rotates between representatives of the three main ethnic groups.\n \nThis system has been in place since the end of the war, and while it has helped to maintain a fragile peace in the country, it has also been criticized for being unwieldy and not fully reflecting the will of the people. Efforts to reform the system have been ongoing, but progress has been slow."

The specific initiatives funded by these programs varied, but they often focused on areas such as education, healthcare, housing, job creation, and strengthening democratic institutions.\n\nSome examples of specific initiatives funded during this period include the World Bank's Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Assistance Strategy, which provided financing for infrastructure projects, institutional development, and social services; the EU's CARDS program, which supported economic reform and integration with the EU; and USAID's programs focused on promoting economic growth, strengthening civil society, and improving governance.\n\nOverall, these programs provided critical financial and technical support to Bosnia and Herzegovina during a period of significant rebuilding and transition, helping the country to stabilize and lay the groundwork for future growth and development.§W\n---------------\n§!Will §RCancel§! if Does not have §YSFOR§!"

 BOS_post_yugoslav_war_state_desc: "Bosnia is one of four republics that managed to declare independence during the Yugoslav wars of the 90s. And of the four, it's the one that experienced the most horrors, with thousands of refugees fleeing from the country. Vast areas of land are tainted by landmines and unexploded ordinance. Many of its former citizens are now living abroad. These events have given the United Nations a new - unsightly - reputation: as an organization that is unable or unwilling to protect those in danger."
