 # Generic Decisions
 cartels_decision_category: "Crime"
 cartels_decision_category_desc: "Criminal organizations are running rampant in our nation. Mafia, drug cartels, and gangs make regular plays for power and influence with little regard for who is hurt or killed in the process. Left unchecked and unmanaged, our state could devolve into the kind of anarcho-criminal states one only sees in American Noirs or De Vaqueros.\n\nThe Political Influence of the Cartels represents their ability to wield our corruption as a weapon against us. The higher their political influence, the less likely it is that we will be able to carry out investigations.\nThe Strength of the Cartels represents their ability to wield violence against us and our people. The higher their strength, the less likely it is that we will be able to carry out raids.\nIf either strength or influence becomes too high, the cartels may try to seize control of our nation.\n\n$political_influence_of_cartels$: [?ROOT.cartel_political_influence]\n$strength_of_cartels$: [?ROOT.strength_of_cartels]\n"
 narcos_crisis: "Narcos Crisis"
 narcos_crisis_desc: "The ability of our government to enforce laws and monopolize force has been compromised by increasing corruption and criminal activity. It is likely that we will soon face a coup from cartel-aligned elements of the military or a mass-uprising by the cartels themselves."
 mafia_crisis: "Mafia Crisis"
 mafia_crisis_desc: "The ability of our government to enforce laws and monopolize force has been compromised by increasing corruption and criminal activity. It is likely that we will soon face a coup from mafia-aligned elements of the military or a mass-uprising by the mafia themselves."
 mexican_cartel_war: "Mexico Cartel War"
 mexican_cartel_war_desc: "The ability of our government to enforce laws and monopolize force has been compromised by increasing corruption and criminal activity. Our military itself has and political infrastructure has been completely compromised and there is not telling who can be trusted anymore. The chaos will soon reach a fever pitch and then, we will be in the midst of a new civil war."

 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision: "Anti-Cartel Propaganda"
 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision_desc: "There has always been a growing myth surrounding the cartels, that they are like the banditos of the rose-tinted past. Lovable rogues that may do bad things but that only do them for the good of their people. Like all myths, it is a fabrication. One that anyone living under the influence of the cartels knows to be false. By exposing the horrors inflicted by them upon their own, in a nation-wide media campaign, we can work towards dispelling this myth once and for all."
 police_investments_decision: "Police Investiture"
 police_investments_decision_desc: "Despite what anyone says about criminal organizations like the cartels, they are well-organized, well-financed, and well-armed. They are not like a herd of sheep that can be dispelled with a few warning shots. Against this organized enemy, our police are the first line of defense and a line of defense that is all too often ill-prepared for the violence that can and has been enacted upon them. Although there are downsides to militarizing our police, it is only through better equipment, tactics, and manpower that they can become the bulwark we need them to be. And for all of that, they need more money."
 utilize_the_military_decisions: "Utilize the Military"
 utilize_the_military_decisions_desc: "Even if our police become as well-armed as their military counterparts, their manpower pool and organization structure will always be limited by local resources and bureaucracy. By deploying our military directly, we gain the assistance of an even more well-armed asset with a more comprehensive command structure and a much wider manpower pool while avoiding local bureaucracy and existing local corruption. However, deploying the military is not popular with the citizens they may eschew the rights of, the police departments they may overreach, and the bureaucrats whose precious infrastructure they may damage. Essentially, what we gain in firepower we lose in public good will."

 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision: "Target Money Laundering Operations"
 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision_desc: "In order to make their ill-gotten money usable to purchase legitimate assets, cartels engage in the practice of money laundering, where cash is put into the financial system, distanced from the source through shifting it around, and then integrated into the launder's legal assets which can be used to legally acquire products or to buy out politicians and other government workers. In order to stem the tide of corruption and to cripple their legal infrastructure, we can attack the second and third steps in the money laundering process. This involves investigating, and shutting down, the banks and business that accept the money and shuffle it around. However, any failures here can compound back on us as the cartels are more likely to become hostile as we attack their cashflow."
 investigate_the_casinos: "Investigate the Casinos"
 investigate_the_casinos_desc: "Already operating as semi-legal businesses that often attempt to skirt laws and regulations, casinos are often the first stop for money entering the financial system due to the fact that the money influx in casinos is rarely questioned and can be made to appear anonymous or innocuous. We can begin by determining casinos which are frequented by known cartel members and investigating their cashflow for dirty money. Once the dirty money is found and a connection is drawn between them and the cartels, we can shut down the businesses, seizing their assets in the process."
 investigates_the_banks: "Investigate the Banks"
 investigates_the_banks_desc: "While more often than not legitimate, banks are a necessary stop for any money laundering operation. By investigating key bank officials and money handlers, while looking into financial records, we can catch transactions before they occur or are finalized. By biding our time in doing this, we can target the largest transactions when the money is nearing its final destination. This results in the most pain for these entities while removing the most possible money from their ecosystem. However, monitoring is hard to maintain as companies and tactics adapt to our interference. That, and closing down the banks is a political impossibility."
 investigate_shell_companies: "Investigate Shell Companies"
 investigate_shell_companies_desc: "Often the middle and final steps in a money laundering scheme, shell companies hold both legal assets and money on behalf of criminal organizations while occasionally shuffling these assets towards a final destination. They are more difficult to target as proving a connection between them and a criminal organization is more difficult but they can have a dramatic impact an organization's operations. These seizures rarely manifest in money, as transfers are often made in smaller quantities but at consistent rates. Instead, they appear as physical assets such as property, vehicles, or even legally purchased weapons."

 target_cartel_drug_running_decision: "Target Drug Running Operations"
 target_cartel_drug_running_decision_desc: "The largest illegal source of revenue for the cartels is their drug-running operations. While some cartels grow the drugs themselves, many make their money by pushing the refined, or unrefined, drugs along the supply chain. By directly targeting and monitoring the routes along which these drugs travel, we can determine both the start points, end points, and mid-way points. This opens up the route for us to raid equipment depots, refineries, farms, drug houses, and bases of operations. Alternatively, we can attack the drugs while en-route. Against larger operations, this is usually ineffective but it can significantly hamper smaller groups who have less resources with which to recoup losses."
 raid_drug_convoys_decision: "Raid Drug Convoys"
 raid_drug_convoys_decision_desc: "By raiding drug convoys while en-route, we can quickly remove drugs from the network for little cost to ourselves. However, larger cartels will typically not be affected by these kinds of raids and will quickly adapt around our monitoring systems. For smaller cartels, this kind of attack can cripple them as they lose essential cash flow and turn on each other in the aftermath."
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision: "Raid Cartel Hideouts"
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision_desc: "By raiding cartel strong points and supply depots, we can hamper their ability to move drugs, organize, and resist incursions into their territory. This usually manifests in the seizure of vehicles and weapons which could have been used against us or their enemies. This can have the added benefit, or downside, of cartels engaging in wars against their weakened rivals."
 raid_distribution_centres_decision: "Raid Distribution Centres"
 raid_distribution_centres_decision_desc: "By raiding cartel distribution centres, such as drug houses as stockpiles, we can remove a large quantity of drugs from the market. This also has the added benefit of hampering the future distribution of drugs through the seizure of large sums of dirty money and the arrests of drug dealers. However, this kind of raid has a high likelihood of a retaliatory strike as it does not inhibit the cartel's ability to enact violence."
 raid_refinement_centres_decision: "Raid Refinement Centres"
 raid_refinement_centres_decision_desc: "By raiding drug labs, plantations, or grow houses, we can inhibit the cartel's ability to create new drugs for distribution while setting them back immensely. This setback is typically enough to hamper their production for months as they attempt to recoup losses. At the same time, it is unlikely to incur a retaliatory strike as most of the cartel's resources are funneled into securing their territory."

 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision: "Target Local Cartel Leaders"
 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision_desc: "Like any organization, cartels require a leadership structure in order to maintain their operations. In arresting, or ensuring the disappearance, of local cartel leaders we can seriously damage that leadership structure. This means less recruits, less operations, and infighting over who should take up the vacant positions. These arrests and deaths have the added benefit of making exceptionally popular news when one of these villains finally gets what they deserve."
 # target_local_political_leaders_decision: "Target Local Political Leaders"
 # target_local_political_leaders_decision_desc: "Like any criminal organization, cartels require a level of corruption to grease the gears of their operations. Removing these corrupt individuals from power is an essential step in strengthening our policing and pushing the cartels out of their own territory. However, attacks against politicians, even local ones, can be misconstrued by our opposition as an attack against the very fabric of democracy in our nation. Especially, if it turns out, that the politicians we sack were innocent from the start."
 # target_local_military_leaders_decision: "Target Local Military Leaders"
 # target_local_military_leaders_decision_desc: "As the political influence of the cartels has grown, they have increasingly found their way into positions where they can appoint or bribe military leaders to their side. This kind of rot is invasive and painful to excise but if not done regularly, it could very well kill our nation as we know it. However, in the process of carrying out our investigations there are bound to be good officers who suffer."

 # Generic Cartel Events
 cartel_event.15.t: "Missing Rifles and Ammunition"
 cartel_event.15.d: "In a recent audit of our national's military bases as part of a measure to curtail the movement of equipment onto the black market, a considerably deficit of small arms and ammunition was uncovered. While the chance remains that it is is a numerical error it is more likely that the equipment has been fenced or is in the process of being fenced. Luckily, the issue is isolated to a single military base where we can bring down our full force."
 cartel_event.15.a: "Curtail on-base activities."
 cartel_event.15.b: "We are already stretched too thin."

 cartel_event.16.t: "Missing Utility Vehicles"
 cartel_event.16.d:  "In a recent audit of our national's military bases as part of a measure to curtail the movement of equipment onto the black market, a considerably deficit of trucks and their spare parts was uncovered. While the chance remains that it is is a numerical error it is more likely that the equipment has been fenced or is in the process of being fenced.

 cartel_event.17.b: "We are already stretched too thin."

 cartel_event.18.t: "Tanks Seized in Port"
 cartel_event.18.d: "In one of our major ports, our port authority uncovered a shipment of antiquated but fully armed and operating Soviet T-55s, alongside spare parts and ammunition. Although we cannot determine their destination or point of origin, we can assume that the lack of any documentation indicates both are illicit. Luckily for us, their final destination is entirely in our hands."
 cartel_event.18.a: "Sell them for scrap."
 cartel_event.18.b: "Press them into service."
 cartel_event.18.c: "Pass them onto our friends."

 cartel_event.19.t: "Body Dump Reaches National News"
 cartel_event.19.d: "The unfortunate discovery of a large body dump in one of our major cities has been picked up by the news cycle, plastering itself on every screen and through every radio. Our window of opportunity in taking back control of the stream of information is slipping away. If we do nothing, fear will take a deeper hold on our people and they will more easily be walked over by the monsters that did this."
 cartel_event.19.a: "Take back control of the narrative."
 cartel_event.19.b: "We are already stretched too thin."

 cartel_event.20.t: "Foreign Celebrity Murdered"
 cartel_event.20.d: "Over the last week, a celebrity from the country of [?var:foreign_celeb_country.GetName] was murdered by a local man. A cursory investigation into the murderer has revealed ties with one of our nation's largest criminal organizations. Already, we are facing outside pressure to take responsibility for the killing in some manner. A few proposals have been pushed forward but the least obtrusive one has been to endorse one of the celebrity's charities."
 cartel_event.20.a: "Endorse the charity."
 cartel_event.20.b: "They shouldn't have associated with criminals."

 cartel_event.21.t: "Cartels Import Exotic Animals"
 cartel_event.21.d: "A fascination with exotic animals has spread among the highest ranking members of our nation's cartels. Usually obtained illegally, these animals are used as signs of power and of office while occasionally being tied to gruesome killings. By tightening our grip on the influx of animals, we could expose the ridiculousness of those engaged in it by forcing an artificial increase in price. While a tiger may be intimidating, spending ten millions dollars on it is an obvious sign of opulence."
 cartel_event.21.a: "Stamp out the trade."
 cartel_event.21.b: "Ignore the trade."

 cartel_event.22.t: "Local Gang Clashes"
 cartel_event.22.d: "A gang war has erupted on the streets of one of our larger cities, hampering the local economy, claiming lives, and making residents afraid to leave their homes. While our analysts predict the violence will not last for long, the public is unlikely be comfortable with the idea of simply waiting out wanton killings. An intervention by our police forces could end the crisis early but would result in large overhead and possible loss of life."
 cartel_event.22.a: "Send in the police."
 cartel_event.22.b: "We are already stretched too thin."

 cartel_event.23.t: "USA Demands Extradition"
 cartel_event.23.d: "The United States of America has demanded the extradition of a drug lord that we have recently managed to put behind bars. In keeping on their good side with the prospects of future assistance against other drug lords, it would be advantageous for us to accept. However, American meddling in our legal system is bound to reduce our own self-reliance."
 cartel_event.23.a: "They can have him."
 cartel_event.23.b: "We can handle our own criminals."

 cartel_event.24.t: "Informant Lands Movie Deal"
 cartel_event.24.d: "One of our informants, a former member of our nation's largest criminal organizations, has been approached by a movie producer who heard about their life through word of mouth and wants to make the stories into a movie. Our informant is enthusiastic to accept but doing so could put his life at risk. We can choose to support the deal and allow the production of the movie or to put an end to any hopes of it within the near future."
 cartel_event.24.a: "Allow the movie deal."
 cartel_event.24.b: "It is too dangerous."

 cartel_event.25.t: "Informant Publishes Memoirs"
 cartel_event.25.d: "It appears as though the recent contact our informant had with a film producer has encouraged him to get his story out there. Over the past weeks, he's worked with several writers and government officials to produce a set of memoirs which can be published anonymously. According to everyone involved, the memoirs are actually very gripping and show the real, gruesome reality of life in the cartels."
 cartel_event.25.a: "I wonder if it will become a bestseller."

 cartel_event.26.t: "Informant Murdered on Set"
 cartel_event.26.d: "The body of our informant was discovered onset after a visit to oversee an important scene. Based on the state of the body, it has been concluded that the killing was done in retaliation by cartel members. Rightfully fearing for their lives, the production team behind the movie has decided to shudder production."
 cartel_event.26.a: "That's a shame."

 cartel_event.27.t: "Film Encourages Criminal Activity"
 cartel_event.27.d: "In what appears to have been the result of crossed wires, the new film about our informant's life is seen more like a De Vaqueros film than a gritty crime tragedy. This has led to an uptick in recruitment among many of our nation's criminal organizations as young men hope to emulate the film's caricatures."
 cartel_event.27.a: "Unfortunaté."

 cartel_event.28.t: "Film Discourages Criminal Activity"
 cartel_event.28.d: "The film that our informant has helped in the production of has reached critical acclaim within the first week of its release. What's more, the realistic depiction of the horrors of the cartels have encouraged more backlash against them. It seems that our young people would now rather grow up to fight the cartels than grow up to join them."
 cartel_event.28.a: "Excellent."

 cartel_event.29.t: "Cartels Execute Border Crossing"
 cartel_event.29.d: "A cartel in one of our neighbouring nations has executed a large-scale border crossing which neither of our border control agencies moved to counter, placing the onus on the other. This has led to a movement within our political apparatus to demand the tightening of our neighbour's borders, as there's no way this has been all our fault."
 cartel_event.29.a: "Demand stricter border control from neighbour."
 cartel_event.29.b: "It could damage our relations to make demands."

 cartel_event.30.t: "Neighbour Demands Border Control"
 cartel_event.30.d: "After a recent cartel border crossing from our country into the nation of [FROM.GetName], our neighbour has demanded that we increase our border security. So far, this has led to many argument within our diplomatic office."
 cartel_event.30.a: "Fine, we'll increase our security."
 cartel_event.30.b: "Why don't they increase their border security?"

 cartel_event.31.t: "Neighbour Accedes to Demands"
 cartel_event.31.d: "Our neighbour, [FROM.GetName], has acceded to our demands of tightened border control. No doubt, our voting base will be very pleased with this victory."
 cartel_event.31.a: "Excellent."

 cartel_event.32.t: "Neighbour Ignores our Demands"
 cartel_event.32.d: "Our neighbour, [FROM.GetName], has ignored our demands of tightened border control. Already, we're being lambasted by the news over our political failure."
 cartel_event.32.a: "Unfortunaté."

 cartel_event.33.t: "Suspicious Transfers tied to Oligarch"
 cartel_event.33.d: "During one of our recent investigations, we uncovered suspicious, albeit not illegal, money transfers from a certain oligarch's fund within our nation. It would be easy to grease the political gears to implicate them in our recent investigation. However, such an overreach would no doubt anger both foreign and domestic oligarchs."
 cartel_event.33.a: "Seize their assets."
 cartel_event.33.b: "Leave them alone."

 cartel_event.34.t: "Cartel Tank Spotted"
 cartel_event.34.d: "During a recent and unsuccessful raid against a cartel target, a tank was spotted being employed by the cartels. Appearing to be a heavily modified Soviet T-34, the tank was even capable of firing its main cannon."
 cartel_event.34.a: "We should do something about that."

 cartel_event.35.t: "Cartel Tank Destroyed"
 cartel_event.35.d: "During a recent successful raid against a cartel target, our agents managed to locate and destroy the T-34 that was seen during one of our recent failures. The victory, especially since it was carried out without anti-tank weapons, has become highly publicized in the news."
 cartel_event.35.a: "Thank God and our brave men."

 cartel_event.36.t: "Cartel Tank Used in Strike"
 cartel_event.36.d: "In the aftermath of one of our recent raids, the cartels made a retaliatory strike against one of our police stations.

Otherwise, the tipper is likely to go to the news."

We treat the cartels like any other interest group, giving them space to operate as they please, and they bankroll several important, upcoming elections.

 # Cartel Decision Events
 cartel_event.50.t1: "Successful Casino Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d1: "After weeks of planning and monitoring, our police forces moved into one of our nation's casinos, seizing millions of dollars in dirty money, collecting important physical evidence, and arresting key players in the cartel's money laundering scheme. Using the evidence collected, we've placed a freeze on all legitimate assets tied to the casino and its operators. With this blow, we've taken out an important piece of infrastructure and hampered their ability to accrue usable funds."
 cartel_event.50.t2: "Successful Bank Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d2: "After weeks of waiting and monitoring of money transfers, today we froze the assets of half a dozen companies and individuals who were tied to a cartel money laundering operation. Warrants have been placed for arrests and multiple smaller investigations have been launched into suspicious transfers between some of the companies and low-level politicians and bureaucrats. While the cartels will inevitably recover, the loss of so much all at once will be a hard blow to their infrastructure."
 cartel_event.50.t3: "Successful Shell Company Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d3: "After weeks of investigation, we have shut down several suspicious companies, seizing their assets in the process. While very little money has been collected, we have seized a large number of properties, civilian vehicles, and other goods.

 cartel_event.50.t4: "Failed Casino Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d4: "In spite of our best efforts, our analyists have been unable to draw a connection between the cartels and the casino upon which our investigation has fallen. What's worse, people have started asking questions about where the money used in the investigation has been going, leading to successful political attacks on our candidates by the opposition.

 cartel_event.50.t5: "Failed Bank Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d5: "In spite of the weeks our agents have spent hunched over computers and monitoring bank transfers, we have come up with no clear opportunity to strike a blow against the cartels.

To add further insult to injury, the cartels continue their operations unimpeded."
 cartel_event.50.t6: "Failed Shell Company Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d6: "In spite of the time and money funnelled into our investigations, all we've uncovered are divorce-security funds and liability protection schemes. What's worse, in the process we have managed to step on the toes of just enough people to have our investigation exposed on the national news. Such an embaressment has more than likely damaged our future election prospects. To add further insult to injury, the cartels continue their operations unimpeded."

 cartel_event.51.d1: "In a recent strike along a known drug route, we managed to seize hundreds of kilograms of drugs, arrest several low-level cartel members, and seize several civilian vehicles with few casualties.

 cartel_event.51.t2: "Successful Cartel Hideout Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d2: "In a recent strike on a known cartel stronghold, we managed to kill or arrest dozens of cartel members while seizing or destroying several pieces of usable military hardware and improvised weapons.

We've also begun rounding up numerous drug dealers tied to the location, seriously hampering their ability to push drugs onto the market and turn a profit. In spite of our success, we should be wary of the possibility of a reprisal attack."
 cartel_event.51.t4: "Successful Refinement Centres Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d4: "In a recent strike on a known refinement centre, we managed to destroy hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and drugs. We've also managed to arrest many of the people involved in the refinement, which will put them at a disadvantage when producing more drugs in the future. In spite of our success, we should be wary of the possibility of a reprisal attack."
 cartel_event.51.t5: "Failed Drug Convoy Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d5: "In a recent attempted strike along a known drug route, our forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat with several casualties being left behind.
