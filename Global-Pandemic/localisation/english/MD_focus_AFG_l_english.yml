 AFG_defensive_army_desc: "Our national situation does not allow us to spend too much of our budget on the military, yet in many cases the combat effectiveness of the military does not depend on the modernity of weapons or numbers, as evidenced by our past efforts to oust the Soviets and the British.

 AFG_decentralization_desc: "One of the key points of the Jamiat-e Islami agenda is decentralisation, Ahmad Shah Massoud has stated that power relations within Afghanistan should follow the Swiss model, effectively creating a decentralised government and a devolution of power from Kabul.

 AFG_secularism_campaign_desc: "One of the key points in Dostum's agenda is to separate religion from politics; this move seeks to increase the power of the central government and sideline the mullahs from politics.

 AFG_junbishi_milli_desc: "Under the republican government of the last century, Afghanistan was able to modernise quickly and women were emancipated, able to participate equally in Afghan society.

 AFG_increase_opium_trade_desc: "Despite our public announcement of our intention of tackling the opium issue, we can secretly support the opium industry by doing nothing about it and even guard the poppy fields with some plain-clothes policemen.

 Afghanistan.15.t: "Assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani"
 Afghanistan.15.d: "This evening, Burhanuddin Rabbani was assassinated in a suicide bombing at his home in Kabul, today is also his 71st birthday. Two men posing as representatives of the Taliban approached him to offer a hug and one of them detonated his explosives hidden inside his turban. The suicide bomber claimed to be a Taliban commander who said to have a very important and a positive message from the Taliban leaders in Pakistan. They said the Taliban wanted to discuss peace with Rabbani. Four other members of our government's High Peace Council were also killed in the blast. Our sources confirmed that Quetta Shura, the Taliban leadership hiding in Quetta, Pakistan, is responsible for this assassination.\n\nRabbani served as the chairman of our nation's High Peace Council after he left a leading role within the government. During that time, he successfully persuaded hundreds of Taliban militants to peacefully lay down their arms. The assassination is a major blow to the peace process in our country as it will be difficult to find someone of his prestige to serve in this position."

 Afghanistan.18.t: "Afghan People Revolt Against Taliban"
 Afghanistan.18.d: "Following Operation Enduring Freedom, several tribal and ethnic minority militias launched uprisings against the Taliban, noticeably in Herat. With assistance from the United States and Iran, these militia have taken control of several areas from the Taliban and joined the command of the Northern Alliance.\n\nThe uprising was met with celebratory gunfire from local residents, some celebrations even include 'dancing on the rooftops' and honking car horns. Mohammad Ismail Khan, one of the key Northern Alliance commanders also known as the \"Lion of Herat\", granted amnesty for former Taliban fighters, but warned of repercussions if said fighters were to take up arms again."

Time will tell all!\" [PAK.GetNameWithFlag]'s President [PAK.GetLeader] responded by rejecting all the claims made by [AFG.GetLeader] and strongly criticised this action stating that \"The hostile diplomatic actions done by [AFG.GetLeader] will do nothing except further damage the relationship between our two countries.\" and called the Afghan government to respect International law.

 AfghanistanNews.8.d: "Due to the corruption of the central government, the economic deprivation and poverty of the people, many Afghans who lost their livelihoods and were disenfranchised with the status quo have joined Hekmatyar's £GFX_AFG_kingdom Hezb-e Islami. A group of Afghan military officers who have not been paid for a long time staged a coup, overthrowing the republican government, declaring a suspension of the current Afghan constitution and the temporary imposition of military control. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who served twice as Afghanistan's Prime Minister in the 1990s, officially ended his exile and returned to Afghanistan as the new President of Afghanistan. Hekmatyar promised to eradicate corruption, revive the economy and lead the Afghan people into a new chapter.

A major protest has started against the ruling government, [AFG.GetLeader]'s government responded by deploying troops into cities and towns and some protestors were fatally shot by the Afghan National Army soldiers or the Afghan National Police units.

 #Taliban Insurgency Events
 TalibanInsurgency.0.t: "The Start of the Taliban Insurgency"
 TalibanInsurgency.0.d: "After the collapse of the main Taliban force, their battalions have fragmented into various splinter cells and have begun waging a guerilla war in every corner of Afghanistan and launching egregious terrorist attacks. It's estimated that the insurgency will take years to quell properly but if we don't act on the situation, we will simply never have stability in our country."
 TalibanInsurgency.0.a: "It's time to get to work!"
 TalibanInsurgency.1.t: "Successful Raid of a Taliban Hideout"
 TalibanInsurgency.1.d: "Thanks to our brave commando units, the Taliban hideout we found was destroyed, some of the Taliban militants attempted to resist but were killed by our commando units while most others surrendered with very few escaping justice. Overall, the operation was a complete success!"
 TalibanInsurgency.1.a: "Excellent!"
 TalibanInsurgency.2.t: "Failure of the Raid"
 TalibanInsurgency.2.d: "Failing to carry out the raid conclusively was a huge blow to our counter-terror commando unit. The Taliban appeared to know our raid plans in advance and launched a preemptive attack on some of our convoys, planting IEDs on our must-go route and ambushing our commandos after the explosion occurred. Several commandos sadly died as a result.\n\nIn debriefing, some military generals suspect that there may have been sympathisers within the organisers of the operation who could have leaked the plan to the Taliban, the debriefing report also criticised corruption from the government that may have led to the loss of the commandos' lives. We must review this failure and learn a lesson from this!"
 TalibanInsurgency.2.a: "Rest in peace to our heroes!"
 TalibanInsurgency.3.t: "Airstrike Successful"
 TalibanInsurgency.3.d: "Good news! Our air force's counter-insurgency aircraft piloted by one of our skilled servicemen has successfully destroyed a Taliban encampment based on coordinates provided by our intelligence agency, the Taliban camp was completely destroyed along with many Taliban militants killed within it.\n\nThis success has shown the effectiveness of our nation’s internal security sector of the intelligence agency and proves that technology is vital in future counter-insurgency operations."
 TalibanInsurgency.3.a: "A great success!"
 TalibanInsurgency.4.t: "Airstrike Failure Killed Civilians"
 TalibanInsurgency.4.d: "Horrible news! Our air force has bombed a target based on coordinates provided by our intelligence agency but it is now obvious that the bombs have hit civilian targets and resulted in the killing of innocent civilians instead of the intended Taliban combatants.\n\nThe local population is in mourning and is rightfully outraged by this failed operation, there are already reports of protests in the area. We must review the reasons for the failure of this particular operation in order to give an explanation to our citizens."
 TalibanInsurgency.4.a: "A tragedy!"
 TalibanInsurgency.5.t: "Aircraft Shot Down by Taliban Militants"
 TalibanInsurgency.5.d: "Tragic news from the airstrike operation! One of our counter-insurgency aircraft has been shot down by Taliban militants using a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile; the pilot has been killed as a result.\n\nThis operational failure has shown that we need to reorganise our airforce for future operations and to obtain better intel of our Taliban targets."
 TalibanInsurgency.5.a: "A heroic pilot, rest in peace!"
 TalibanInsurgency.6.t: "Success of Unity Propaganda"
 TalibanInsurgency.6.d: "Thanks to our unity propaganda efforts, some Taliban fighters have come to our police and military checkpoints and laid down their weapons, some have hugged our soldiers and local police. Our soldiers and police did not give them too much trouble, instead, they gave many of the Taliban militants who laid down their weapons some toll money to get them home. This has caused growth in public trust of the government and national unity."
 TalibanInsurgency.6.a: "A successful development!"
 TalibanInsurgency.7.t: "Failure of Unity Propaganda"
 TalibanInsurgency.7.d: "It has been hugely disappointing to our government that our recent unity propaganda effort did not have positive returns. The word from some of the Taliban commanders at the bottom is that Taliban leadership sees the current Afghan government as a government of thieves, a puppet of a foreign government, and not at all representative of the Afghan nation. They consider themselves to be the real Afghans."
 TalibanInsurgency.7.a: "Maybe we need to do more on our part..."
 TalibanInsurgency.8.t: "The Elimination of the Taliban Insurgency"
 TalibanInsurgency.8.d: "A few hours ago the Afghan government officially confirmed that they have successfully wiped out the Taliban insurgency. According to information released by the Afghan government, the vast majority of the Taliban have peacefully laid down their weapons and returned to their homes.\n\nA few hardened Taliban militants have fled across the Afghan-Pakistani border to the Pakistani tribal areas and joined local militant groups within the area. Since the Afghan government has sufficiently constructed security measures along the Afghan-Pakistani border, it is unlikely that the militants entrenched in Pakistan will infiltrate back across the border."
 TalibanInsurgency.8.a: "Is the long-lasting conflict finally at an end?"
 TalibanInsurgency.10.t: "Taliban Launches Large Scale Insurgency"
 TalibanInsurgency.10.d: "The recent surge in Taliban attacks and an increase in violence has given the Taliban an opportunity to escalate the insurgency into civil war once more. The Taliban has taken a large swathe of the rural territory, making up a main southwestern stronghold along with some other rural areas falling to their rule.\n\nA small part of the Afghan National Army has seen soldiers deserting and some of those deserters have joined the Taliban, most have chosen to stay and resist the Taliban due to fear of being liquidated by the Taliban.\n\nWhether the international community will support us remains uncertain but we must rally our soldiers and fight towards victory."
 TalibanInsurgency.10.a: "We have no choice but to fight!"
 TalibanInsurgency.11.t: "Taliban Launches Large Scale Insurgency"

 TalibanInsurgency.11.a: "Afghanistan is at war again..."
 TalibanInsurgency.14.t: "The Situation in Afghanistan"
 TalibanInsurgency.14.d: "We know that the Afghan government has allowed us to station troops in their territory but our military intelligence agency warns that the Taliban is currently waging an insurgency throughout every corner of Afghanistan and that there are a multitude of other terrorist groups taking advantage of the unstable situation in Afghanistan. The terror threat has reached a critical level that could pose a real danger to our troops stationed there.\n\nIf we continue to maintain our troops’ position in Afghanistan, they are likely to be targeted by the Taliban and other terrorist groups active in the nation. However, should we stay in the country, we can choose to assist the Afghan government forces in their counter-insurgency operations. If we choose to do so, our military can gain valuable experience such as different counter-insurgency and counter guerrilla warfare techniques, and can protect our citizens in Afghanistan.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader], if you choose to continue stationing troops in Afghanistan, we won't stop you, but please think carefully if it is really worth the risk."
 TalibanInsurgency.14.a: "We will contribute to Afghan counter-insurgency efforts."

 TalibanInsurgency.17.d: "Thanks to our brave commando units, the Taliban hideout we found was destroyed, some of the Taliban militants attempted to resist but were killed by our commando units while most others surrendered with very few escaping justice. Overall, the operation was a complete success!"
 TalibanInsurgency.17.a: "Excellent!"
 TalibanInsurgency.18.t: "Failure of the Raid"
 TalibanInsurgency.18.d: "Failing to carry out the raid conclusively was a huge blow to our counter-terror commando unit. The Taliban appeared to know our raid plans in advance and launched a preemptive attack on some of our convoys, planting IEDs on our must-go route and ambushing our commandos after the explosion occurred. Several commandos sadly died as a result.\n\nIn debriefing, some military generals suspect that there may have been sympathisers within the organisers of the operation who could have leaked the plan to the Taliban, the debriefing report also criticised corruption from the government that may have led to the loss of the commandos' lives. We must review this failure and learn a lesson from this!"
 TalibanInsurgency.18.a: "Rest in peace!"
 TalibanInsurgency.21.t: "Drone Strike Successful"
 TalibanInsurgency.21.d: "Our drone strike on the Taliban was successful! Our drone was able to spot, strike and destroy several Taliban hideouts near an urban zone, crippling their military capabilities in the area and temporarily leaving their local leadership structure completely disorganised.\n\nAlthough scared of the drone strike at first, the local population have now celebrated the retreat of the Taliban insurgents, at least for now."
 TalibanInsurgency.21.a: "Drones are the future of warfare!"
 TalibanInsurgency.22.t: "Failed Drone Strike Killed Civilians"
 TalibanInsurgency.22.d: "Today, one of our drones targeted and destroyed what appeared to be a Taliban hideout near a residential area, but recent intelligence reports concluded that the targeted building was in fact a small apartment building occupied by civilians.\n\nMedia reporters are already covering the incident and many groups are criticising our involvement in this war."
 TalibanInsurgency.22.a: "It was a technical error!"
 TalibanInsurgency.23.t: "Bombing Operation Successful"
 TalibanInsurgency.23.d: "Intelligence reports that today one of our strategic bombers destroyed a Taliban tunnel complex hidden in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan.\n\nOur successful bombing campaign is starting to paralyse Taliban operations in the isolated areas of the country and the collapse of their infrastructure will force the Taliban to surrender in time."
 TalibanInsurgency.23.a: "The jihadists will learn to fear our air power!"
 TalibanInsurgency.24.t: "Mistaken Bombing has Killed Civilians"
 TalibanInsurgency.24.d: "Today, a catastrophic incident occurred!\n\nOur air force bombed a mountainous area in eastern Afghanistan until we discovered that there was no Taliban encampments in the area, but in fact, a small village between the mountains. The village was absolutely destroyed as a result of our bombing run.\n\nThe credibility of our air campaign has been called into serious repute. Our politicians and military command are being accused of war crimes against the Afghan people."
 TalibanInsurgency.24.a: "This is terrible!"
 TalibanInsurgency.25.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Provides Technical Equipment"
 TalibanInsurgency.25.d: "A message from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government to our leadership has stated that [FROM.GetNameDef] will provide us some counter-insurgency technical equipment including explosive detection devices that can be installed on highways or in door entrances, dogs trained specifically to detect hidden explosives as well as some other electronics to improve our military and police's effectiveness in dealing with the Taliban insurgency.\n\nThe equipment is expected to arrive within a month and will hopefully reduce the growth of the Taliban insurgency, at least for a short period of time."
 TalibanInsurgency.25.a: "We are grateful for the help!"

 #Leader Description:
 GULBUDDIN_HEKMATYAR_DESC: "Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is an Afghan politician and former mujahideen leader. He is the founder and leader of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin political party, so called after Mohammad Yunus Khalis split from Hezb-e Islami in 1979 to found Hezb-i Islami Khalis. He served as Prime Minister twice during the 1990s. Hekmatyar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s, where he was known for his Islamic radicalism rejected by much of the organization.\n\nHe spent time in Pakistan before returning to Afghanistan when the Soviet–Afghan War began in 1979, at which time the CIA began funding his rapidly growing Hezb-e Islami organization through the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI, one of the largest of the Afghan mujahideen. He received more CIA funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War.\n\nFollowing the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992, Hekmatyar declined to form part of the new government and, with other warlords, engaged in the Afghan civil war, leading to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone. Hekmatyar was accused of bearing the most responsibility for the rocket attacks on the city. In the meantime, as part of the peace and power-sharing efforts led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly from 1996 to 1997."
 MOHAMMED_ZAHIR_SHAH_DESC: "Serving for 40 years, Zahir was the longest-serving ruler of Afghanistan since the foundation of the Durrani Empire in the 18th century. He expanded Afghanistan's diplomatic relations with many countries, including with both sides of the Cold War. In the 1950s, Zahir Shah began modernising the country, culminating in the creation of a new constitution and a constitutional monarchy system. Demonstrating nonpartisanship, his long reign was marked by peace in the country that was lost afterwards.\n\nIn 1973, while Zahir Shah was undergoing medical treatment in Italy, his regime was overthrown in a coup d'etat by his cousin and former prime minister, Mohammed Daoud Khan, who established a single-party republic, ending more than 225 years of continuous monarchical government.\n\nZahir Shah is the best suiting candidate to revive a monarchist Afghanistan and to prolong his family's claim to the throne."
