But people forget to mention that this expression also comes from the necessity associated with a lack of resources and help. Most Brazilians have to be creative and invent new more straightforward ways to do things they need. The word \"jeitinho\" comes from the expression dar um jeito, literally \"to find a way\".

 brazil.21.t: "Evangelical Judge Takes Seat"
 brazil.21.d: "President Bolsonaro has this week appointed his second judge to the Supreme Court, Judge Andre Mendonca. Finally fulfilling Bolsonaro's campaign promises and satisfying much of the religious majjority that helped him get elected. This makes Judge Mendonca another conservative pick for the insitution with two more judges to be appointed. However, this event has stirred up some controversy in relation to Brazil's stated secularity of government as Judge Mendonca has stated in the past that he views the process of conversion back to religion inevitable and has exercised his view that the government should give more power to religious insitutions."
 brazil.21.a: "God is just and so is our Justice!"
 brazil.22.t: "Creation of a New Party"
