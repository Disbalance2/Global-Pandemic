In order to attack the whole ICBM fleet and do any significant damage, the enemy would have to attack every silo. With enough silos, they would use up much of their warhead inventory to destroy only a couple of missiles, a cost that was so high they would not contemplate it."

When the first warhead went off, it would create a huge cloud of debris that was ejected thousands of feet into the sky. When the next warhead arrived it would hit this debris and be destroyed. This strategy is also known as 'dust defense'."

 terminal_phase_defense: "Terminal Phase Defense"
 terminal_phase_defense_desc: "The terminal phase of a missile trajectory begins when the payload begins to reenter the atmosphere. Interceptions during the terminal phase are among the simplest, both technically and in terms of tracking. Against a large attack with many warheads, there may be little time to arrange all of the interceptions. More importantly, waiting until the last moment necessarily means the interception takes place at shorter range which means protecting a large area may require a very large number of interceptor bases spread over that area."
 boost_phase_defense: "Boost Phase Defense"
 boost_phase_defense_desc: "The boost phase is the portion of the flight of a missile during which the booster and sustainer engines operate until it reaches peak velocity. Boost-phase intercept is a type of missile defense technology that would be designed to disable enemy missiles while they are still in the boost phase. Such defenses have the advantage of being able to easily track their targets through the infrared signature of the rocket exhaust, and that boosters are generally much less robust than the warheads. Destroying the booster also destroys all of the warheads and decoys."

 reactor1: "Magnox"
 reactor1_desc: "Magnox reactors are designed to run on natural uranium with carbon dioxide gas as the coolant. Earliest types were constructed in the late 1950's right into the 70's until Light Water reactors replaced most of them. Its simple design and low power density made it a safe and cost-effective reactor for being a Gen I reactor."
 reactor2: "LWR"
 reactor2_desc: "Light-water reactor is an umbrella term for reactors using normal water for its coolant and neutron moderator. Its three varieties are the most common type of nuclear reactors as it's design is simpler and cheaper. Technological breakthroughs after previous reactors rendered these as GEN II 'Commercial Power Reactors'."
 reactor3: "ABWR"
 reactor3_desc: "Advanced Boiling water reactor is a type built on previous boiling water systems for improved output. Its state of the art boiling system makes it the earliest Gen III reactor. Multiple new additions in safety and an addition of digital controls gives the reactors a huge leap ahead of earlier reactor designs."
 reactor4: "System 80+"
 reactor4_desc: "This updated version of System 80 Pressurized Water reactor marks many changes for improved costs and safety. The powerful reactor can handle not only civilian grade plutonium but even military-grade in such a way to also store it for future use."
 reactor5: "AP1000"
 reactor5_desc: "Further improvements in the technology surrounding pressurized water has cut down cost and increased efficiency. A passive safety system in place requires less manpower for the same performance. The first smaller design (AP600) was not considered cost-effective enough even if it were among the world's first GEN III reactors."
 reactor6: "VVER-1200"
 reactor6_desc: "Increased capacity and fuel efficiency takes nuclear fission to new heights. Refined modern safety systems and new refueling cycles extends not only the lifespan but also top efficiency to at least 90%."
 reactor7: "APWR"
 reactor7_desc: "Advanced pressurized water reactor features several design enhancements including a neutron reflector, improved efficiency and improved safety systems. It integrates active and passive systems with two more trains to lower the risk even further."
 reactor8: "CFR-1000"
 reactor8_desc: "Its smaller predecessor (CFR-600) was designed as to test new methods with liquid sodium instead of the \"usual\" water coolant. The CFR-1000 is its larger commercial scale reactor but could easily handle weapon-grade plutonium as well."
 reactor9: "MSR"
