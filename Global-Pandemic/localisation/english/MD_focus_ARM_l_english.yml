The heads of the two countries had a tête-à-tête conversation, then the meeting continued in an expanded format. The parties discussed the development of the political dialogue between Yerevan and Athens, the activation of ties in the trade, economic, cultural and military spheres.

 arme.1000.t: "The era of Kocharyan"
 arme.1000.d: "After the end of the Artsakh War, Armenia found itself in a very grave condition. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent rule of Levon Ter-Petrosyan led the country to chaos and the rise of banditry. The shooting of the Armenian parliament in 1999 by dissidents, behind whom were unknown forces, only added fuel to the fire of the fragmented public and government. After the relative stabilization of society, well-known both in the military-political and in the criminal circles, President Robert Kocharian became a key figure in keeping the current order in which the opposition parties are gaining momentum more and more and want to lead Armenia in their own way, as it seems to them, the right path. The communists, who have great support among the people after the fall of Soviet power, shocked by the execution of their leader Karen Demirchyan, are ready to close their eyes to all the prerequisites for a bad alliance and unite with pro-Western and small parties in order to take revenge and return the socialist system to Armenia. At the same time, the pro-Western parties, represented by the first President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan, are preparing new rallies in order to declare themselves as a significant political force that must be reckoned with and which, on occasion, will lead the people, even if for they will have to unite with the nationalist Zhirayr Sefilian or with the communists. The weakest force in the opposition is the disorganized small parties that lack clear leadership, but with the right political knack, even they can take over in this Russian-backed house of cards. At the moment, Kocharian has many political problems, but using his connections in the army, oligarchy and foreign diplomacy, he needs to make a responsible decision."
 arme.1000.a: "Sure, this guy gonna' get us to prosperity, right?"
 arme.1001.t: "Armenian Military"
 arme.1001.d: "After the end of the Artsakh War, the Armenian army, which had shown itself, experienced a significant decline, which began even after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the Soviet legacy, as well as a large-scale militia, the Armenians managed to defeat Azerbaijan and establish a precarious balance in the region. Old doctrines, as well as outdated weapons, ossified generals and economic problems put an end to the development of the armed forces. The main way of development is the continuation of cooperation with Russia, as well as with other neighbors and partners in the CSTO. However, some military experts insist on a complete overhaul of the military doctrine and structure of the army along the Western lines. Armenia, being in a diplomatically advantageous position, can try to take the best from each side, or take a clear course of cooperation with certain forces. Even without significant resources, Armenia has great potential if it can correctly distribute its priorities."
 arme.1001.a: "Tell the Turks what kind of army we have!"
 arme.1002.t: "Armenian Air Force"
 arme.1002.d: "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, with a very limited air force, the Armenian Air Force has shown itself to be ambiguous. During the Artsakh war, the pilots relied solely on the remaining Soviet infrastructure, as well as on trophies obtained during the hostilities. The main emphasis of the state went to air defense, leaving the combat wings as an appendage of the armed forces. With the beginning of the 21st century, in order to adapt to modern warfare and its specifics, Armenia must begin large-scale purchases and modernize its air doctrine."
 arme.1002.a: "We'll have to get out of the situation"
 arme.1003.t: "Succession issue"

Levon Ter-Petrosyan is convinced that it is necessary to come to an agreement with Azerbaijan by returning 7 regions in exchange for Stepanokert, while Zharayr Sefilyan considers the entire Artsakh to be Armenian territory. In any case, even former president Robert Kocharyan was from Karabakh. "
