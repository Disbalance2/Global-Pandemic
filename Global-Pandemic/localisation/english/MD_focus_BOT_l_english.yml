 BOT_model_student_of_africa: "Model Student of Africa"
 BOT_model_student_of_africa_desc: "Botswana is one of the most highly developed countries in Africa. Ever since its independence, it has been a stable democracy and has seen very little conflict. Boasting the highest human development index and the lowest perceived corruption in sub-Saharan Africa, Botswana is a shining light for the rest of Africa to follow.\n\n§RIf our §YCorruption Level§! is higher than §Y$widespread_corruption$§! we will lose this bonus!§!"
 BOT_kalahari_expansion: "Kalahari Desertification"
 BOT_kalahari_expansion_desc: "The Kalahari Desert in the Western part of Botswana covers a large area. Year after year, this desert expands more. As 95% of Botswana receives so little rainfall that it is not viable for agriculture, 71% of the country is being used for agricultural grazing and most people get their water from groundwater. The large cattle industry makes the desertification worse, though almost half of Botswanans get their income from it.\n\nWestern Botswana is also a home to many national parks (which make up 20% of the country's land area), the largest of which is the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, home to the San People and one of the largest diamond mines in Botswana.\n\n§YEvery year we will get an update on the desertification status of the Kalahari. The desertification might continue, the situation might stabilise or the situation could improve (oasification). The likelihoods of each outcome can be seen in the $BOT_anti_poaching_decisions$ decision category.\n\nWe can continue exploiting the already suffering Kalahari and the surrounding Savannah and make the desertification worse, or we can try to take a conservationist approach to slow down or even reverse it.§!"

 Botswana_pulse.1.t: "Kalahari Desert Expands"
 Botswana_pulse.1.d: "According last year's data, the Kalahari Desert has continued expanding. Several areas meant for grazing are now barren, multiple groundwater sources have dried up and wildlife has been cut down due to poaching. Allowing people to freely graze their cattle where they want, mineral exploitation of the region and ignoring poaching is bound to make the situation worse."
 Botswana_pulse.1.a: "Shame"
 Botswana_pulse.2.t: "Kalahari Desert Normal"
 Botswana_pulse.2.d: "According last year's data, the desertification situation in and around the Kalahari seems to be holding steady. It is however only a matter of time before it gets worse again. Allowing people to freely graze their cattle where they want, mineral exploitation of the region and ignoring poaching is bound to make the situation worse."
 Botswana_pulse.2.a: "We have been given more time"
 Botswana_pulse.3.t: "Kalahari Desert Retreats"
 Botswana_pulse.3.d: "According last year's data, vegetation has grown part into large areas of the Kalahari. Mimicking natural grazing patterns and combating poaching will allow the area to heal itself."
 Botswana_pulse.3.a: "We have made progress"
 Botswana_pulse.4.t: "£BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP Secures Yet Another Victory!"

 Botswana_pulse.5.t: "£BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP Splits in a Scandal!"
 Botswana_pulse.5.desc: "The ruling £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP is going through a scandal. A faction within the party, fed-up with President [ROOT.GetLeader]'s policies and failure to garner popular support has split from the main party."
 Botswana_pulse.5.a: "Predictable"
 Botswana_pulse.6.t: "Opposition Forms an Electoral Alliance"
 Botswana_pulse.6.desc: "Several opposition parties have come together under a single electoral alliance. After meeting of opposition party leaders, they came to the conclusion that the only way to topple the £BOT_Neutral_conservatism BDP is by working together. The new alliance will be known as £BOT_neutral_Social_UDC UDC - Umbrella for Democratic Change."
 Botswana_pulse.6.a: "Pointless"
 Botswana_pulse.7.t: "£BOT_neutral_Social_UDC UDC Splits"
 Botswana_pulse.7.desc: "Now that the £BOT_neutral_Social_UDC UDC has reached their goal of winning an election, there is no need for an electoral alliance. The parties have decided that in the next election they will once again campaign independently."
 Botswana_pulse.7.a: "Interesting"
 Botswana_pulse.8.t: "The Negro of Banyoles Returns"
 Botswana_pulse.8.desc: "In 1830, the corpse of a San individual was taxidermied by the French Verraux brothers. The piece of taxidermy eventually ended up in a museum in Catalonia, Spain. It wasn't until 1991 that the piece became controversial, and in 1997 after talks at the UN the museum decided that the taxidermied man would be disassembled, and what human remains were left would be returned to Botswana. The 'package' has now arrived. What should we do with the remains?"

 Botswana_pulse.8.b: "He's been dead for 200 years, just archive him somewhere"
 Botswana_pulse.9.t: "Execution of Mariette Bosch"
 Botswana_pulse.9.desc: "Mariette Bosch was a South African woman who murdered the spouse of her lover in 1996 by shooting her twice. The murder was originally thought to be just a robbery gone wrong with no suspects. Bosch was executed by hanging in March of 2001. What made the case exceptional was that she was the first white woman to be executed in Botswana and she was a South African national. The execution itself was botched, as her family was on the way to meet her the same day she was executed and the South African President [SAF.GetLeader] was planning a campaign of pardon for her. Neither party were informed that the execution was going to take place beforehand."
 Botswana_pulse.9.a: "Well that could've gone better"
 Botswana_pulse.10.t: "Bushmen Sue the Government"
 Botswana_pulse.10.desc: "An interest group of the San Bushmen have sued the government over the relocations that have been taking place since the 1970s.

 Botswana_pulse.11.desc: "The Kosigkolo of the Bantele people Tawana II died recently. His sister, Mosadi Seboko claimed the crown on the basis of bogosi, or birthright equality, as she was the oldest child. There was much opposition to her claim, as there has never been a female Kgosikgolo before. However, the Botswanan constitution doesn't prevent this. Eventually she was officially crowned and took her place in the House of Chiefs. She is an eager advocate of women's rights in Botswana."
 Botswana_pulse.11.a: "A step towards equality"
 Botswana_pulse.12.t: "Strike at an Indstrial Site"
 Botswana_pulse.12.desc: "Several thousand workers recently held a strike at an industrial site. In the end, the courts ruled the strike as illegal.

Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond set off in cheap cars at the Eastern edge of Botswana with the goal to drive all the way across the country to the border with Namibia to prove that they can handle rough terrain better than SUVs. One of the highlights of the start of the special was as the Botswanan President [ROOT.GetLeader] arrived on a glider to wish good luck on the Brits just before they started crossing the Kalahari. Question is, which one of them fares the best?"

 Botswana_pulse.15.desc: "A Moremi Air operated Cessna 208 crashed yesterday near Xakanaka camp just after takeoff. 8 out of 12 people on board died, which included French, British and Swiss nationals (including the British pilot of the plane). The crash was caused by an engine failure as the compressor turbine blades were affected by sulfidation corrosion, which wasn't noticed in any of the plane's inspection. Many are calling for inspection and tighteting of flying standards in the country, but this could hurt many of the Safari organising companies."
 Botswana_pulse.15.a: "Demand stricter control!"
 Botswana_pulse.15.b: "This is just a single accident"
 Botswana_pulse.16.t: "Another Plane Crash"
 Botswana_pulse.16.desc: "While the Moremi Air crash is still in people's memory, another similar accident has occurred. A small turboprob plane operated by a Safari organiser has crashed after taking off. Luckily, only a handful of people died in the accident. Should we start tightening flying standards in the country now?"
 Botswana_pulse.16.a: "Demand stricter control!"
 Botswana_pulse.16.b: "This is just a single accident"
 Botswana_pulse.17.t: "Mmusi and Others v Ramantele and Another"
 Botswana_pulse.17.desc: "A court case has appeared in Botswana regarding an inheritance issue. According to traditional courts operating in rural Botswana, the youngest male child always inherits the home of their father. The issue started when a man and his half-brother were at odds of inheriting their father's home. Both men died before the dispute could be solved however. The house would then pass to the half-brother's son Molefi Ramantele. This was disputed by his aunts, who had been taking care of the financial burden of the home ever since the dispute started. A Botswana court ruled in favour of the aunts, stating that the traditional method of inheriting is unconstitutional. This was the first time a woman's right to inherit property was affirmed in Botswana."

 Botswana_pulse.20.desc: "A massive diamond has been found once again in the Karowe mine. The total weight is around 1700 carats (350 grams) and it is around the size of a tennis ball. This makes it the third largest diamond found, surpassing the previous Lesedi La Rona. It has been named Sewelô (Rare Find). Louis Vitton is currently interested in buying the diamond. Unusual for a diamond, it is covered in a thin layer of black carbon making cutting it very challenging."
 Botswana_pulse.20.a: "It's magnificent!"
 Botswana_pulse.21.t: "Electricity Shortage"
 Botswana_pulse.21.desc: "Most of Southern Africa, including Botswana, gets most of their energy from South Africa.

 Botswana_pulse.22.desc: "Motor Company of Botswana has been producing Hyundai cars in Botswana since 1993. Founded by a wealthy Zimbabwean man, the company has at times taken to shady business practices to get cars cheaply exported to South Africa by importing them first from Mozambique, disassembling and reassembling them and then shipping them to South Africa. Yesterday the company announced it was closing its doors due to high debt that it can no longer operate with. Hyundai itself is planning to move the assembly line to Kimberley, South Africa, causing a loss of 900 jobs in Botswana."

 Botswana_pulse.23.desc: "The Kgosi of one of the larger tribes is being accused of flogging one of their tribe members for alleged crimes. The Kgosi is arguing that this is perfectly fine, and that the Kgosi are immune from the state's jurisdiction.

 Botswana_events.5.a: "Great!"
 Botswana_events.6.t: "Unsuccessful Rhino Dehorning Campaign"
 Botswana_events.6.desc: "Hundreds of Rhino individuals have been dehorned in the past months. However, this seems to have had no effect on the poachers. Poachers track rhinos as usual, and if they catch a dehorned rhino, they shoot it anyway not to risk wasting time tracking the animal again.
