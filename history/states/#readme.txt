#read this if you plan on modding states in any capacity
#
#if you create a new state, remember these key things:
 # transfer resources, factories, population etc accordingly (ex. if you split a state in two)
 # set the correct state_category according to the population (see the list at the bottom)
 # victory points be put in the correct state file
 # make sure provinces don't overlap in two different states
 # buildings are corrected in nudge, that goes for unitstacks aswell if provinces are altered
 # if the game crashes on start up ask for help (its most likely air bases in wrong prov)
 # read the error log for any mentions of the former or new state added
#
#if you mod in an existing state make sure that:
 # everything said above is correct
 # be more hesitant if your changes gives the country controlling the state more longterm advantages, as balance can be rubbed in favour to one country for something like adding an extra naval factory.
#
#if you create or mod coastal states you need to add/mod the respective missile launch point triggers for the coastal state and all adjacent seazones
# examples when you need to modify the missile launch point triggers:
#	- you have a state with a coastline to one seazone, now you change the map so that the coastline of the state covers two seazones
#	- you have a state with a coastline to two seazones, now you change the map so that the coastline of the state only covers one seazone
#	- you add a new state with a coastline
#	- you remove a state with a coastline
#	- you split a state with a coastline into two states
#	- you merge two states with a coastline into one
#	- every other change to states with coastline that adds or removes adjacent seazones
#	- you change the seazones with islands or coastlines
# how you do this:
 # there are 5 files that have to be adapted in \common\scripted_triggers
 # MD_missile_sea_launch_points.txt
 # MD_missile_sea_launch_points_attack_sub.txt
 # MD_missile_sea_launch_points_CV.txt
 # MD_missile_sea_launch_points_defense.txt
 # MD_missile_sea_launch_points_sub.txt
 # there is a example at the top of each file, you either have to adept the existing scripted triggers or add new ones in all five files
# please also add your changes to the list at the bottom of this file
